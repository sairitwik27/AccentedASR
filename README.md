# AccentedASR
Repository for Accented English ASR experiments.

The ind_asr/local directory contains all the custom scripts used for the project. An example of how to use these scripts is presented in ind_asr/dann_train.sh and ind_asr/dann_test.sh


The easiest way to use the repository is to make a clone of the ind_asr and copy it into the wsj recipe of espnet1. Then the scripts in local and ind_asr should work well.
