Kannada-0003-2433	SCIENTISTS CONTEND THAT THE ALLUVIAL SOIL OF THE NORTHERN STATES BENEFIT MORE FROM SLOW PRECIPITATION 
Kannada-0003-2434	WHILE THE HARDROCK GEOGRAPHY OF THE SOUTH NEEDS HEAVY SHOWERS FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
Kannada-0003-2435	YET MANY DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SHORT HEAVY SPELLS AND NOT STEADY RAIN 
Kannada-0003-2436	A FUTUREREADY APPROACH SHOULD THEREFORE FOCUS ON AUGMENTED STORAGE AND GREATER PARTICIPATION OF THE FARMING COMMUNITY IN MANAGING THE VITAL RESOURCE

Kannada-0003-2439	INDIAS BENCHMARK STOCK INDICES ARE ROARING AGAIN WITH THE NIFTY AND THE SENSEX SCALING ALLTIME HIGHS ON FRIDAY CROSSING THE ELEVEN THOUSANDS AND THIRTY SEVEN THOUSANDS LEVELS RESPECTIVELY
Kannada-0003-2440	A RESULT LARGELY OF INCREASED BUYING BY FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND EXPECTATIONS OF STRONG FIRSTQUARTER EARNINGS RESULTS 
Kannada-0003-2441	IT TOOK THE SENSEX JUST THIRTEEN TRADING SESSIONS TO MOVE FROM THIRTY SIX THOUSANDS TO THIRTY SEVEN THOUSANDS POINTS
Kannada-0003-2442	COMING AFTER BOTH INDICES WITNESSED EXTREMELY SHARP CORRECTIONS A FEW MONTHS AGO 
Kannada-0003-2443	THE RALLY HAS OCCURRED WHEN OTHER EMERGING MARKET INDICES HAVE FAILED TO RECOVER THEIR LOSSES SINCE THE FALL IN FEBRUARY 
Kannada-0003-2444	THE SWIFT RECOVERY HOWEVER IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF A SECULAR RISE WHILE THE SHARP MARKET CORRECTION IN FEBRUARY HIT STOCKS ACROSS THE BOARD 
Kannada-0003-2445	THIS RALLY HAS BEEN LIMITED TO A FEW POCKETS OF THE MARKET
Kannada-0003-2446	HEAVYWEIGHT BLUECHIP STOCKS SUCH AS HDFC RELIANCE INDUSTRIES ITC TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES AND INFOSYS HAVE CONTRIBUTED THE MOST WHILE MANY OTHERS HAVE LAGGED BEHIND
Kannada-0003-2447	ALMOST HALF THE COMPANIES IN THE NIFTY STILL TRADE BELOW THEIR TWO HUNDREDDAY MOVING AVERAGE A SIGN OF INSUFFICIENT PRICE STRENGTH
Kannada-0003-2448	THE DIVERGENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS STOCKS BECOMES CLEARER WHEN LARGE CAPS ARE COMPARED TO SMALLER COMPANIES 
Kannada-0003-2449	THE MIDCAP AND THE SMALLCAP INDICES WHICH FELL MORE SHARPLY THAN THE BENCHMARK INDICES EARLIER THIS YEAR ARE STILL TRADING WELL BELOW THEIR HISTORIC HIGHS IN JANUARY 
Kannada-0003-2450	WHILE THE SENSEX HAS GAINED ALMOST TEN PERCENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THE MID AND SMALLCAP INDICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN

Kannada-0003-2453	SEVERAL STOCKS IN THE MID AND SMALLCAP CATEGORY HAVE FALLEN TO LEVELS REMINISCENT OF A BEAR MARKET 
Kannada-0003-2454	INVESTORS ARE NOW PROBABLY SEEKING SAFETY IN A FEW LARGECAP STOCKS THAT OFFER BETTER QUALITY OF EARNINGS COMPARED TO UNTESTED AND RISKIER SMALLER COMPANIES 
Kannada-0003-2455	THE RETURN OF FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL BUYING ALSO SUGGESTS THAT INVESTORS MAY BE BETTING ON INDIA OVER OTHER EMERGING MARKETS THAT HAVE SUFFERED MORE SEVERELY

Kannada-0003-2457	AND THE SOLEMN PROMISES WHICH HE HAD REPEATEDLY MADE IN THE FACE OF THE WHOLE WORLD 
Kannada-0003-2458	IT COULD HARDLY BE DOUBTED THAT THE CHARGES WHICH IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION TO BRING AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLIC RELIGION WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY ALL PROTESTANTS AS FULLY ESTABLISHED 
Kannada-0003-2459	FOR IF EVER A ROMAN CATHOLIC COULD BE EXPECTED TO KEEP FAITH WITH HERETICS JAMES MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO KEEP FAITH WITH THE ANGLICAN CLERGY 
Kannada-0003-2460	TO THEM HE OWED HIS CROWN 
Kannada-0003-2461	BUT FOR THEIR STRENUOUS OPPOSITION TO THE EXCLUSION BILL HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A BANISHED MAN 
Kannada-0003-2462	HE HAD REPEATEDLY AND EMPHATICALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS OBLIGATION TO THEM AND HAD VOWED TO MAINTAIN THEM IN ALL THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS

Kannada-0003-2466	HE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CONSTITUTIONALLY OR HABITUALLY TREACHEROUS 
Kannada-0003-2467	TO HIS BLUNT MANNER AND TO HIS WANT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS

Kannada-0004-2474	IN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THE COLONIAL REGIME PASSED THE NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL TRIBES ACT 
Kannada-0004-2475	THIS LAW WAS BASED UPON THE RACIST BRITISH BELIEF THAT IN INDIA THERE WERE ENTIRE GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES THAT WERE CRIMINAL BY BIRTH NATURE AND OCCUPATION 
Kannada-0004-2476	THE ACT UNLEASHED A REIGN OF TERROR WITH ITS SYSTEMS OF SURVEILLANCE POLICE REPORTING THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES DETENTION CAMPS AND FORCED LABOUR 
Kannada-0004-2477	MORE THEN SIX DECADES AFTER INDEPENDENT INDIA REPEALED THE ACT THE DENOTIFIED TRIBES CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM STIGMA AND SYSTEMIC DISADVANTAGE
Kannada-0004-2478	THE ACT WAS ONE STRAND OF A WEB OF COLONIAL LAWS THAT DEHUMANISED COMMUNITIES AND WAYS OF LIFE 
Kannada-0004-2479	THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATORS WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT NOMADIC AND ITINERANT COMMUNITIES WHICH BY VIRTUE OF THEIR MOVEMENTS AND LIFESTYLE WERE DIFFICULT TO TRACK SURVEIL CONTROL AND TAX 
Kannada-0004-2480	THROUGH LAWS SUCH AS THE CRIMINAL TRIBES ACT AND OTHER LEGAL WEAPONS SUCH AS VAGRANCY LAWS THE REGIME ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY THESE PATTERNS OF LIFE 
Kannada-0004-2481	BY USING CRIMINAL LAWS TO COERCE COMMUNITIES INTO SETTLEMENTS AND SUBJECTING THEM TO FORCED LABOUR
Kannada-0004-2482	INDEPENDENCE BROUGHT WITH IT MANY CHANGES BUT ALSO MUCH CONTINUITY 
Kannada-0004-2483	DESPITE THE BIRTH OF A CONSTITUTION THAT PROMISED LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY AND DIGNITY TO ALL 
Kannada-0004-2484	INDEPENDENT INDIAS RULERS CONTINUED TO REPLICATE COLONIAL LOGIC IN FRAMING LAWS FOR THE NEW REPUBLIC 
Kannada-0004-2485	THEY CONTINUED TO TREAT INDIVIDUALS AS SUBJECTS TO BE CONTROLLED AND ADMINISTERED RATHER THAN RIGHTSBEARING CITIZENS 
Kannada-0004-2486	ONE OF THE MOST GLARING EXAMPLES OF THIS IS THE BOMBAY PREVENTION OF BEGGING ACT 
Kannada-0004-2487	THE BEGGING ACT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN HUNDRE FIFTY FINE BY THE STATE OF BOMBAY AND HAS CONTINUED TO EXIST IN AS MANY AS TWENTY STATES AND TWO UNION TERRITORIES 
Kannada-0004-2488	BUT LAST WEEK IN A REMARKABLE LANDMARK AND LONG OVERDUE JUDGMENT THE DELHI HIGH COURT STRUCK IT DOWN AS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION
Kannada-0004-2489	WHAT DOES THE BEGGING ACT DO IT CRIMINALISES BEGGING IT GIVES THE POLICE THE POWER TO ARREST INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT A WARRANT 
Kannada-0004-2490	IT GIVES MAGISTRATES THE POWER TO COMMIT THEM TO A CERTIFIED INSTITUTION FOR UP TO THREE YEARS ON THE COMMISSION OF THE FIRST OFFENCE AND UP TO TEN YEARS UPON THE SECOND OFFENCE
Kannada-0004-2491	BEFORE THAT IT STRIPS THEM OF THEIR PRIVACY AND DIGNITY BY COMPELLING THEM TO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE FINGERPRINTED 
Kannada-0004-2492	THE ACT ALSO AUTHORISES THE DETENTION OF PEOPLE DEPENDANT UPON THE BEGGAR  AND THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN OVER THE AGE OF FIVE 
Kannada-0004-2493	CERTIFIED INSTITUTIONS HAVE ABSOLUTE POWER OVER DETAINEES INCLUDING THE POWER OF PUNISHMENT AND THE POWER TO EXACT MANUAL WORK 
Kannada-0004-2494	DISOBEYING THE RULES OF THE INSTITUTION CAN LAND AN INDIVIDUAL IN JAIL
Kannada-0004-2495	FROM ITS FIRST WORD TO THE LAST THE BEGGING ACT REFLECTS A VICIOUS LOGIC FIRST THERE IS THE DEFINITION OF BEGGING 
Kannada-0004-2496	THE ACT DEFINES IT TO INCLUDE SOLICITING OR RECEIVING ALMS IN A PUBLIC PLACE WHETHER OR NOT UNDER ANY PRETENCE SUCH AS SINGING DANCING FORTUNE TELLING 
Kannada-0004-2497	IN ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE COURTS OF SPAIN AND OF ROME WOULD HAVE EAGERLY APPLAUDED A PRINCE WHO HAD MADE VIGOROUS WAR ON HERESY 
Kannada-0004-2498	BUT SUCH WAS THE HATRED INSPIRED BY THE INJUSTICE AND HAUGHTINESS OF LEWIS THAT WHEN HE BECAME A PERSECUTOR
Kannada-0004-2499	THE COURTS OF SPAIN AND ROME TOOK THE SIDE OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY 
Kannada-0004-2500	AND LOUDLY REPROBATED THE CRUELTY OF TURNING A SAVAGE AND LICENTIOUS SOLDIERY LOOSE ON AN UNOFFENDING PEOPLE

Kannada-0004-2503	IT WAS CLEAR THEN THAT THE SPIRIT OF GARDINER AND OF ALVA WAS STILL THE SPIRIT OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH 
Kannada-0004-2504	LEWIS WAS NOT INFERIOR TO JAMES IN GENEROSITY AND HUMANITY 
Kannada-0004-2505	AND WAS CERTAINLY FAR SUPERIOR TO JAMES IN ALL THE ABILITIES AND ACQUIREMENTS OF A STATESMAN 
Kannada-0004-2506	LEWIS HAD LIKE JAMES REPEATEDLY PROMISED TO RESPECT THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS PROTESTANT SUBJECTS 
Kannada-0004-2507	YET LEWIS WAS NOW AVOWEDLY A PERSECUTOR OF THE REFORMED RELIGION 
Kannada-0004-2508	WHAT REASON WAS THERE THEN TO DOUBT THAT JAMES WAITED ONLY FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE 
Kannada-0004-2509	HE WAS ALREADY FORMING IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW A MILITARY FORCE OFFICERED TO A GREAT EXTENT BY ROMAN CATHOLICS 
Kannada-0004-2510	WAS THERE ANYTHING UNREASONABLE IN THE APPREHENSION THAT THIS FORCE MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO DO WHAT THE FRENCH DRAGOONS HAD DONE

Kannada-0007-2593	SOME TWO THOUSAND US SOLDIERS ARE DEPLOYED IN THE KURDISH AUTONOMOUS AREAS AND BOTH RUSSIA AND SYRIA WOULD PREFER NOT TO GET INTO A DIRECT EXCHANGE OF FIRE WITH US SOLDIERS 
Kannada-0007-2594	HOWEVER A DEAL WITH THE KURDS COULD UPSET TURKEY WHICH SEES SYRIAN KURDISH REBELS AS AN EXTENDED ARM OF THE KURDISTAN WORKERS PARTY WHICH IT CALLS TERRORIST 
Kannada-0007-2595	THE SYRIAN REGIME THEREFORE HAS TO DO A BALANCING ACT HERE WITH SUPPORT FROM RUSSIA 
Kannada-0007-2596	IN THE BATTLE FOR DERAA RUSSIA MANAGED TO CONVINCE THE US JORDAN AND ISRAEL THAT THE REGIMES CAPTURE OF THE PROVINCE WAS THE BESTCASE SCENARIO FOR THE REGION

Kannada-0007-2598	THE ONGOING CRISIS IN ASSAM OVER THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF CITIZENS IS LARGELY THE CREATION OF THE SUPREME COURT 
Kannada-0007-2599	THE FINAL DRAFT LIST OF CITIZENS PUBLISHED ON JULY THIRTY  LEAVES OUT THE NAMES OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY LAKH RESIDENTS OF ASSAM 
Kannada-0007-2600	ALTHOUGH POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF HAVE ASSURED EVERYONE THAT THIS IS ONLY A DRAFT AND EVERYONE WILL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY
Kannada-0007-2601	TO PROVE HIS OR HER CITIZENSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW BEFORE ANY ACTION IS TAKEN THIS IS UNLIKELY TO INSPIRE MUCH CONFIDENCE GIVEN WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED THUS FAR
Kannada-0007-2602	THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE NRC CAN BE TRACED TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION FILED IN THE SUPREME COURT BY ASSAM PUBLIC WORKS 
Kannada-0007-2603	SEEKING THE REMOVAL OF ILLEGAL VOTERS FROM THE ELECTORAL ROLLS OF ASSAM AND THE PREPARATION OF THE NRC AS REQUIRED UNDER THE CITIZENSHIP ACT NINETEEN HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE AND ITS RULES 
Kannada-0007-2604	THE NRC WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PREPARED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ASSAM ACCORD SIGNED BETWEEN THE UNION GOVERNMENT AND THE ALLASSAM STUDENTS UNION 
Kannada-0007-2605	TO END THE AGITATION AGAINST OUTSIDERS PROMISING TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE ANY FOREIGNERS FROM ASSAM WHO HAD ENTERED THE STATE AFTER NINETEEN HUNDRE SEVENTY ONE
Kannada-0007-2606	THOUGH THE FIRST NRC WAS FRAMED IN NINETEEN HUNDRE FIFTY ONE IT AND SUBSEQUENT ITERATIONS WERE RECOGNISED
Kannada-0007-2607	TO BE FAULTY AND THE PRESENT EXERCISE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TWO THOUSAND THREE RULES
Kannada-0007-2608	THOUGH FILED IN TWO THOUSANDS AND NINE THE CASE REALLY PICKED UP STEAM IN TWO THOUSANDS AND THIRTEEN AS THE SUPREME COURT DIRECTED THE UNION AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS 
Kannada-0007-2609	A DEADLINE OF JANUARY TWO THOUSANDS AND SIXTEEN WAS INITIALLY FIXED TO COME UP WITH THE DRAFT OF THE NRC THOUGH THAT WAS MISSED AND AFTER MUCH DELAY 
Kannada-0007-2610	ALL THREE POINT THREE CRORE RESIDENTS OF ASSAM WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTS FROM A LIST PRESCRIBED BY THE GOVERNMENT
Kannada-0007-2611	TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE INDEED CITIZENS OF INDIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN FRAUGHT WITH COMPLEXITY AND CONFUSION
Kannada-0007-2612	GIVEN THAT CITIZENSHIP IS A LEGAL FICTION ESTABLISHED OR DENIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROCEDURE UNDER LAW 
Kannada-0007-2613	ONE WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT THE SUPREME COURTS MONITORING OF THE PROCESS WOULD HAVE ENSURED FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY 
Kannada-0007-2614	FROM THE NONTRANSPARENT FAMILY TREE VERIFICATION PROCESS TO THE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY REJECTION OF THE GRAM PANCHAYAT
Kannada-0007-2615	THESE ARE NOT MINOR ERRORS FOR INSTANCE THE SUPPOSEDLY ROBUST FAMILY TREE VERIFICATION PROCESS HAS RESULTED IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF PARENTS BEING ON THE DRAFT LIST
Kannada-0007-2616	BUT CHILDREN BEING LEFT OUT PRECISELY THE KINDS OF ERRORS WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCLUDED 
Kannada-0007-2617	THE DIVISION WAS TAKEN ON THE QUESTION WHETHER MIDDLETONS MOTION SHOULD BE PUT 
Kannada-0007-2618	THE NOES WERE ORDERED BY THE SPEAKER TO GO FORTH INTO THE LOBBY
Kannada-0007-2619	THEY RESENTED THIS MUCH AND COMPLAINED LOUDLY OF HIS SERVILITY AND PARTIALITY FOR THEY CONCEIVED THAT ACCORDING TO THE INTRICATE AND SUBTLE RULE WHICH WAS THEN IN FORCE 
Kannada-0007-2620	AND WHICH IN OUR TIME WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE RATIONAL AND CONVENIENT PRACTICE THEY WERE ENTITLED TO KEEP THEIR SEATS 
Kannada-0007-2621	AND IT WAS HELD BY ALL THE PARLIAMENTARY TACTICIANS OF THAT AGE THAT THE PARTY WHICH STAYED IN THE HOUSE HAD AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE PARTY WHICH WENT OUT
Kannada-0007-2622	FOR THE ACCOMMODATION ON THE BENCHES WAS THEN SO DEFICIENT THAT NO PERSON WHO HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD SEAT WAS WILLING TO LOSE IT 
Kannada-0007-2623	NEVERTHELESS TO THE DISMAY OF THE MINISTERS MANY PERSONS ON WHOSE VOTES THE COURT HAD ABSOLUTELY DEPENDED WERE SEEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR 
Kannada-0007-2624	AMONG THEM WAS CHARLES FOX PAYMASTER OF THE FORCES AND SON OF SIR STEPHEN FOX CLERK OF THE GREEN CLOTH 
Kannada-0007-2625	THE PAYMASTER HAD BEEN INDUCED BY HIS FRIENDS TO ABSENT HIMSELF DURING PART OF THE DISCUSSION 
Kannada-0007-2626	BUT HIS ANXIETY HAD BECOME INSUPPORTABLE 
Kannada-0007-2627	HE COME DOWN TO THE SPEAKERS CHAMBER HEARD PART OF THE DEBATE WITHDREW AND AFTER HESITATING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO 
Kannada-0007-2628	BETWEEN CONSCIENCE AND FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR TOOK A MANLY RESOLUTION AND RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE JUST IN TIME TO VOTE 
Kannada-0007-2629	TWO OFFICERS OF THE ARMY COLONEL JOHN DARCY SON OF THE LORD CONYERS AND CAPTAIN JAMES KENDALL WITHDREW TO THE LOBBY

Kannada-0008-2631	LIKEWISE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE REJECTION OF PANCHAYAT RESIDENCY CERTIFICATES IS MORE THAN FOURTY FIVE LAKH A LITTLE MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE FINAL LIST
Kannada-0008-2632	THE REJECTION OF THE PANCHAYAT CERTIFICATES HAS A JUDICIAL ANGLE TO IT AS WELL 
Kannada-0008-2633	IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSANDS AND SEVENTEEN IN MANOWARA BEWA VERSUS UNION OF INDIA THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT DECLARED THAT CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY GRAM PANCHAYATS COULD NOT BE RELIED
Kannada-0008-2634	THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF PUTTING THE CITIZENSHIP OF A LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO RELIED ON THIS DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH MARITAL RELATIONSHIPS IN DOUBT 
Kannada-0008-2635	THE SUPREME COURT DIDNT IMMEDIATELY SET IT ASIDE AS THE ASSAM GOVERNMENT DID NOT FILE AN APPEAL AGAINST IT 
Kannada-0008-2636	RATHER IT WAS ONLY IN DECEMBER THAT THE SUPREME COURT CLARIFIED THAT THE PANCHAYAT CERTIFICATES COULD BE RELIED UPON 
Kannada-0008-2637	PROVIDED THE DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN APPROPRIATELY PROVED IN COURT 
Kannada-0008-2638	HOWEVER IT DID NOT FINALLY SETTLE THE MATTER IT REMANDED THE MATTER BACK TO THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT FOR FRESH EXAMINATION 
Kannada-0008-2639	THE FATE OF LAKHS OF PEOPLE RELYING ON THESE DOCUMENTS REMAINS UNCERTAIN AS EACH PERSON WILL NOW HAVE TO PROVE NOT ONLY HIS OR HER LINKAGES AFRESH BUT ALSO THE DOCUMENTS
Kannada-0008-2640	YET NONE OF THIS ENTERED THE COURTS CALCULUS 
Kannada-0008-2641	WHY PREPARING THE NRC WITHIN A DEADLINE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ENSURING THAT THERE WAS LEGAL CLARITY OVER THE MANNER
Kannada-0008-2642	IN WHICH THE CLAIMS OF CITIZENSHIP COULD BE DECIDED IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE SUPREME COURT THOUGHT IT FIT TO CLARIFY OR GO INTO AT ANY STAGE IN ITS HEARING OF THE CASE
Kannada-0008-2643	A MUCH LARGER QUESTION ALSO REMAINS UNANSWERED AND ONE WHICH THE COURT HAS NOT DEIGNED TO ASK ITSELF IN THE NINE YEARS IT HAS BEEN SEIZED OF THIS MATTER TO WHAT END THIS EXERCISE 
Kannada-0008-2644	EVEN IF THE OBJECTIONS AND CORRECTIONS ARE PROPERLY DEALT WITH THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE UNABLE TO PROVE INDIAN CITIZENSHIP 
Kannada-0008-2645	THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THEY WILL LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE WHICH TEMPORARILY ENDS THE PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION 
Kannada-0008-2646	BUT THAT ONLY RESULTS IN THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROBLEM WHAT WILL BE THE STATUS OF THE SEVERAL LAKH INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD HAVE SUDDENLY LOST INDIAN CITIZENSHIP WITH NO RECOURSE IN SIGHT
Kannada-0008-2647	EVEN AT THE LATEST HEARING WHICH TOOK PLACE ON JULY THIRTY ONE THE SUPREME COURT SEEMED UNPERTURBED BY THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS ACTIONS
Kannada-0008-2648	ALL THE WHILE MAKING THE RIGHT NOISES ABOUT THERE BEING NO IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT FOUND THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST AND THERE BEING MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO QUESTION THE ABSENCE OF NAMES ON THE NRC 
Kannada-0008-2649	AT SOME POINT THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE CONFRONTED WITH THE UNDENIABLE QUESTION 
Kannada-0008-2650	WHAT ACTION CAN IT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE INDIAN CITIZENS
Kannada-0008-2651	WILL IT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT THE CRUDE COMMUNAL RHETORIC DOING THE ROUNDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND PUSH THEM OUT 
Kannada-0008-2652	WILL IT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BASIC RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN RENDERED STATELESS AND DEFENCELESS 
Kannada-0008-2653	OR WILL IT TAKE THE PONTIUS PILATE OPTION AND WASH ITS HANDS OF THE WHOLE MATTER
Kannada-0008-2654	DURING THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DEBATES BR AMBEDKAR REMARKED THAT THE PROVISION RELATING TO CITIZENSHIP IN THE CONSTITUTION CAUSED THE DRAFTING COMMITTEE 
Kannada-0008-2655	THE MOST HEADACHE SAVE FOR ONE OTHER CLAUSE AS MULTIPLE DRAFTS WERE WORKED ON AND REJECTED OVER THE YEARS BEFORE THE PRESENT ARTICLE FIVE WAS SETTLED UPON FOR GOOD REASON TOO 
Kannada-0008-2656	THE HOUSE THEN RESOLVED ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF SUPPLY TO BE GRANTED 
Kannada-0008-2657	THE KING WANTED FOURTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS BUT THE MINISTERS SAW THAT IT WOULD BE VAIN TO ASK FOR SO LARGE A SUM 
Kannada-0008-2658	THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER MENTIONED TWELVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS 
Kannada-0008-2659	THE CHIEFS OF THE OPPOSITION REPLIED THAT TO VOTE FOR SUCH A GRANT WOULD BE TO VOTE FOR THE PERMANENCE OF THE PRESENT MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
Kannada-0008-2660	THEY WERE DISPOSED TO GIVE ONLY SO MUCH AS MIGHT SUFFICE TO KEEP THE REGULAR TROOPS ON FOOT TILL THE MILITIA COULD BE REMODELLED AND THEY THEREFORE PROPOSED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS 
Kannada-0008-2661	THE COURTIERS EXCLAIMED AGAINST THIS MOTION AS UNWORTHY OF THE HOUSE AND DISRESPECTFUL TO THE KING BUT THEY WERE MANFULLY ENCOUNTERED 
Kannada-0008-2662	ONE OF THE WESTERN MEMBERS JOHN WINDHAM WHO SATE FOR SALISBURY ESPECIALLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF 
Kannada-0008-2663	HE HAD ALWAYS HE SAID LOOKED WITH DREAD AND AVERSION ON STANDING ARMIES AND RECENT EXPERIENCE HAD STRENGTHENED THOSE FEELINGS 
Kannada-0008-2664	HE THEN VENTURED TO TOUCH ON A THEME WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED 
Kannada-0008-2665	HE DESCRIBED THE DESOLATION OF THE WESTERN COUNTIES 
Kannada-0008-2666	THE PEOPLE HE SAID WERE WEARY OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE TROOPS WEARY OF FREE QUARTERS OF DEPREDATIONS OF STILL FOULER CRIMES WHICH THE LAW CALLED FELONIES 
Kannada-0008-2667	BUT FOR WHICH WHEN PERPETRATED BY THIS CLASS OF FELONS NO REDRESS COULD BE OBTAINED 
Kannada-0008-2668	THE KINGS SERVANTS HAD INDEED TOLD THE HOUSE THAT EXCELLENT RULES HAD BEEN LAID DOWN FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ARMY 
Kannada-0008-2669	BUT NONE COULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT THESE RULES HAD BEEN OBSERVEDWHAT THEN WAS THE INEVITABLE INFERENCE 
Kannada-0008-2670	DID NOT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PATERNAL INJUNCTIONS ISSUED FROM THE THRONE AND THE INSUPPORTABLE TYRANNY OF THE SOLDIERS PROVE THAT THE ARMY WAS EVEN NOW TOO STRONG FOR THE PRINCE AS WELL AS FOR THE PEOPLE 
Kannada-0008-2671	THE COMMONS MIGHT SURELY WITH PERFECT CONSISTENCY WHILE THEY REPOSED ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE INTENTIONS OF HIS MAJESTY

Kannada-0009-2674	AS SCHOLAR NIRAJA GOPAL JAYAL HAS OBSERVED THIS WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE INDIAN NATIONALISM DURING THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE ITSELF ON EXCLUSIVE RACIAL OR ETHNIC BASES
Kannada-0009-2675	SEVENTY YEARS LATER INDIAS APPROACH TO CITIZENSHIP IS ONCE AGAIN GOING TO BE SCRUTINISED BY THE WORLD

Kannada-0009-2682	MR KHAN NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE ON THE CRICKET PITCH THE WINNER IS A PLAYING TEAM IN PAKISTANI POLITICS THE ARMY IS THE UMPIRE AND CALLS THE SHOTS
Kannada-0009-2683	EVERY ELECTION IS GUIDED BY A HAWA A WAVE AND AFTER SO MANY ELECTIONS THE ARMY HAS BECOME ADEPT AT MANIPULATING THE HAWA
Kannada-0009-2684	IN THE TWO THOUSAND TWO ELECTIONS WITH GEN PERVEZ MUSHARRAF IN CHARGE IT WAS CLEAR THAT NEITHER THE PAKISTAN PEOPLES PARTY NOR THE PAKISTAN MUSLIM LEAGUENAWAZ COULD BE ALLOWED TO WIN
Kannada-0009-2685	AND SO A NEW PARTY THE PAKISTAN MUSLIM LEAGUE  OR PML EMERGED TO SWEEP THE ELECTION 
Kannada-0009-2686	INCIDENTALLY THE PML HAS BEEN REDUCED TO FIVE SEATS THIS TIME AND WILL SUPPORT MR KHAN
Kannada-0009-2687	IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ELECTION BENAZIR BHUTTOS ASSASSINATION IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CREATED A SYMPATHY WAVE FOR THE PPP 
Kannada-0009-2688	BUT AN ACCOMMODATING PRESIDENT AND HER HUSBAND ASIF ALI ZARDARI ENSURED THAT THE ARMY REMAINED IN CONTROL OF KEY POLICY MATTERS 
Kannada-0009-2689	FIVE YEARS LATER DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PPPS MISGOVERNANCE PROPELLED NAWAZ SHARIF TO VICTORY AND HE WAS SWORN IN AS PRIME MINISTER FOR THE THIRD TIME 
Kannada-0009-2690	IRONICALLY EVEN THOUGH MR SHARIFS POLITICAL CAREER WAS NURTURED UNDER THE BENIGN GAZE OF GEN ZIAULHAQ IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
Kannada-0009-2691	HIS RELATIONS WITH THE ARMY HAVE INVARIABLY BEEN STRAINED EVERY TIME HE HAS BEEN PRIME MINISTER THE FIRST TIME HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER IN NINETEEN NINETY 
Kannada-0009-2692	HE ENDED UP BEING DISMISSED BY PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE OVER GROWING DIFFERENCES WITH CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF 
Kannada-0009-2693	HISTORY REPEATED ITSELF AND THIS TIME TOO 
Kannada-0009-2694	HIS RELATIONS WITH THE ARMY DETERIORATED FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONWARDS WITH THE DAWN LEAKS ABOUT A MEETING WHERE THE ARMYS FLAWED AFGHAN POLICY WAS HELD RESPONSIBLE
Kannada-0009-2695	FOR PAKISTANS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION AND WORSENING LAW AND ORDER SITUATION AT HOME 
Kannada-0009-2696	THE ARMY WAS NOT AMUSED AND HELD THE PRIME MINISTERS OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EMBARRASSING DISCLOSURE 
Kannada-0009-2697	THE PANAMA PAPERS CAME IN USEFUL TO BEGIN AN INQUIRY INTO MR SHARIFS FINANCIAL ASSETS EVENTUALLY LEADING TO A JUDGMENT ON SOMEWHAT FLIMSY GROUNDS RESULTING IN HIS RESIGNATION LAST YEAR 
Kannada-0009-2698	ON THE SAME DAY IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE SPIRIT OF OPPOSITION HAD SPREAD FROM THE COMMONS TO THE LORDS AND EVEN TO THE EPISCOPAL BENCH 
Kannada-0009-2699	WILLIAM CAVENDISH EARL OF DEVONSHIRE TOOK THE LEAD IN THE UPPER HOUSE AND HE WAS WELL QUALIFIED TO DO SO 
Kannada-0009-2700	IN WEALTH AND INFLUENCE HE WAS SECOND TO NONE OF THE ENGLISH NOBLES AND THE GENERAL VOICE DESIGNATED HIM AS THE FINEST GENTLEMAN OF HIS TIME 
Kannada-0009-2701	HIS MAGNIFICENCE HIS TASTE HIS TALENTS HIS CLASSICAL LEARNING HIS HIGH SPIRIT THE GRACE AND URBANITY OF HIS MANNERS WERE ADMITTED BY HIS ENEMIES 
Kannada-0009-2702	HIS EULOGISTS UNHAPPILY COULD NOT PRETEND THAT HIS MORALS HAD ESCAPED UNTAINTED FROM THE WIDESPREAD CONTAGION OF THAT AGE 
Kannada-0009-2703	THOUGH AN ENEMY OF POPERY AND OF ARBITRARY POWER HE HAD BEEN AVERSE TO EXTREME COURSES HAD BEEN WILLING WHEN THE EXCLUSION BILL WAS LOST 
Kannada-0009-2704	TO AGREE TO A COMPROMISE AND HAD NEVER BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ILLEGAL AND IMPRUDENT SCHEMES WHICH HAD BROUGHT DISCREDIT ON THE WHIG PARTY 
Kannada-0009-2705	BUT THOUGH REGRETTING PART OF THE CONDUCT OF HIS FRIENDS HE HAD NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT FAILED TO PERFORM ZEALOUSLY THE MOST ARDUOUS AND PERILOUS DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP

Kannada-0014-2874	THROUGH NO FAULT OF ITS OWN FRANCES TALENTED SQUAD HAS FOUND ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IDEOLOGICAL BATTLE WHICH HAS MOSTLY REVOLVED AROUND ITS ALLEGED AFRICANNESS
Kannada-0014-2875	THIS DEBATE HAS A LONG HISTORY 
Kannada-0014-2876	BACK IN THE MIDNINETEEN NINETYS THE FRENCH FARRIGHT MADE MUCH OF THE FACT THAT THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM WAS NOT REALLY FRENCH BECAUSE IT INCLUDED SO MANY BLACK AND BROWN PLAYERS WITH DIVERSE ORIGINS 
Kannada-0014-2877	THE SQUAD RESPONDED TO THESE CRITICISMS BY WINNING THE WORLD CUP FOR FRANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND GIVING RISE TO WILD HOPES THAT A SELFCONSCIOUSLY MULTICULTURAL TEAM WOULD ALLOW THE FRENCH TO EMBRACE ITS COMPLEX HERITAGE
Kannada-0014-2878	UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED 
Kannada-0014-2879	THE FARRIGHT CONTINUED TO GROW CULMINATING IN THE SHOCK PRESENCE OF THE OPENLY RACIST JEANMARIE LE PEN IN THE SECOND ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO
Kannada-0014-2880	AT THE SAME TIME YOUNG FRENCH PEOPLE OF AFRICAN CARIBBEAN AND NORTH AFRICAN ORIGIN COMPLAINED BITTERLY ABOUT DISCRIMINATION UNEMPLOYMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM 
Kannada-0014-2881	THIS LED TO RIOTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN THE COUNTRYS IMPOVERISHED BANLIEUES SUBURBS ERUPTED INTO VIOLENCE
Kannada-0014-2882	MORE RECENTLY SEVERAL FRENCH CITIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART BY TERRORISM AS EUROPEAN FOLLOWERS OF ISLAMIC STATE 
Kannada-0014-2883	HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF A COUNTRY THAT IN THE EYES OF MANY RADICAL ISLAMISTS IS UNIQUELY HOSTILE TO ISLAM
Kannada-0014-2884	NOT EVEN FOOTBALL COULD REDEEM A FRACTURED SOCIETY ZIDANES INFAMOUS HEADBUTT IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX WORLD CUP FINAL THE FRENCH TEAMS EMBARRASSING MUTINY AND EARLY EXIT FROM THE TWO THOUSAND TEN WORLD CUP 
Kannada-0014-2885	AND KARIMS EXPULSION FROM THE TEAM IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FOR BLACKMAILING HIS FELLOW PLAYERS ONLY FANNED THE FLAMES OF THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT THE ROOTS OF FRANCES ILLS LAY IN ITS PROLIFERATION OF ETHNIC MINORITIES
Kannada-0014-2886	ALL OF THIS MEANT THAT THE FRENCH DID NOT HAVE VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR TEAM IN THIS WORLD CUP 
Kannada-0014-2887	FEW BELIEVED THAT ANOTHER MULTIETHNIC MELTING POT OF STAR PLAYERS COULD SOLVE THE COUNTRYS PROBLEMS AND 
Kannada-0014-2888	EVEN AFTER THE FRENCH VICTORY NO POLITICAL COMMENTATOR HAS BEEN WILLING TO BET ON REDEMPTION THROUGH FOOTBALL 
Kannada-0014-2889	THERE IS A KEEN AWARENESS TODAY THAT THE STEADY TRICKLE OF CRITICS WHO WANT TO USE THE COMPOSITION OF THE FRENCH FOOTBALL TEAM AS A PLATFORM FOR RAMPANT XENOPHOBIA WILL SOON RETURN
Kannada-0014-2890	IMAGINE THE SURPRISE IN FRANCE THEN WHEN RADICAL TWITTER AND LATENIGHT COMEDY SHOWS STARTED TO TURN THIS AGEOLD ACCUSATION ON ITS HEAD 
Kannada-0014-2891	IN PARTICULAR IN A MUCHCIRCULATED SEGMENT OF HIS ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN TV SHOW SOUTH AFRICAN COMEDIAN TREVOR NOAH OPENLY CONGRATULATED THE FRENCH BY SAYING THAT AFRICA WON THE WORLD CUP
Kannada-0014-2892	FRANCE PLAYERS CELEBRATE AFTER WINNING THE FIFA WORLD CUP TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FINAL AGAINST CROATIA IN MOSCOW ON JULY FIFTEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN
Kannada-0014-2893	THE RESPONSE WAS INSTANTANEOUS A WHOLE RAFT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN FRANCE ACCUSED NOAH OF RACISM 
Kannada-0014-2894	AND EVEN THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE US WAS MOVED TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE COMEDIAN TO TELL HIM THAT HIS COMMENTS THREATENED THE INTEGRITY OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC 
Kannada-0014-2895	NOAH REPLIED BY SAYING THAT THE FRENCH SHOULD LEARN TO EMBRACE THEIR MULTIPLE IDENTITIES AND RECOGNISE THEIR COLONIAL HERITAGE
Kannada-0014-2896	THIS AWKWARD STANDOFF REFLECTS A WELLKNOWN PECULIARITY OF FRENCH POLITICAL CULTURE NAMELY THE FRENCH STATES FORMAL COMMITMENT TO A COLOURBLIND REPUBLICAN PHILOSOPHY OF INTEGRATION
Kannada-0014-2897	THAT CONSIGNS QUESTIONS OF RACE AND RELIGION TO THE PRIVATE SPHERE 
Kannada-0014-2898	IT IS THE SAME LOGIC THAT LED THE FRENCH STATE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO BAN THE WEARING OF THE ISLAMIC HEADSCARF AND OTHER RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS IN FRENCH STATE SCHOOLS
Kannada-0014-2899	JEFFREYS WAS APPOINTED HIGH STEWARD HE SELECTED THIRTY TRIERS 
Kannada-0014-2900	AND THE SELECTION WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN AND OF THE TIMES 
Kannada-0014-2901	ALL THE THIRTY WERE IN POLITICS VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED TO THE PRISONER 
Kannada-0014-2902	FIFTEEN OF THEM WERE COLONELS OF REGIMENTS AND MIGHT BE REMOVED FROM THEIR LUCRATIVE COMMANDS AT THE PLEASURE OF THE KING 
Kannada-0014-2903	AMONG THE REMAINING FIFTEEN WERE THE LORD TREASURER THE PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE THE STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD 
Kannada-0014-2904	THE COMPTROLLER OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND OF GENTLEMEN PENSIONERS THE QUEENS CHAMBE 
Kannada-0014-2905	AND OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE BOUND BY STRONG TIES OF INTEREST TO THE COURT 
Kannada-0014-2906	NEVERTHELESS DEL HAD SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES OVER THE HUMBLER CULPRITS WHO HAD BEEN ARRAIGNED AT THE OLD BAILEY 
Kannada-0014-2907	THERE THE JURYMEN VIOLENT PARTISANS TAKEN FOR A SINGLE DAY BY COURTLY SHERIFFS FROM THE MASS OF SOCIETY AND SPEEDILY SENT BACK TO MINGLE WITH THAT MASS 
Kannada-0014-2908	WERE UNDER NO RESTRAINT OF SHAME AND BEING LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO WEIGH EVIDENCE FOLLOWED WITHOUT SCRUPLE THE DIRECTIONS OF THE BENCH 
Kannada-0014-2909	BUT IN THE HIGH STEWARDS COURT EVERY TRIER WAS A MAN OF SOME EXPERIENCE IN GRAVE AFFAIRS 
Kannada-0014-2910	EVERY TRIER FILLED A CONSIDERABLE SPACE IN THE PUBLIC EYE 
Kannada-0014-2911	EVERY TRIER BEGINNING FROM THE LOWEST HAD TO RISE SEPARATELY AND TO GIVE IN HIS VERDICT ON HIS HONOUR BEFORE A GREAT CONCOURSE 
Kannada-0014-2912	THAT VERDICT ACCOMPANIED WITH HIS NAME WOULD GO TO EVERY PART OF THE WORLD AND WOULD LIVE IN HISTORY 
Kannada-0014-2913	MOREOVER THOUGH THE SELECTED NOBLES WERE ALL TORIES AND ALMOST ALL PLACEMEN MANY OF THEM HAD BEGUN TO LOOK

Kannada-0018-3036	IT HAS ALSO BEEN LINKED TO MASTITIS A PAINFUL INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER 
Kannada-0018-3037	MILK CONSUMERS WORRY ABOUT EXPOSURE TO IT THROUGH DAIRY PRODUCTS THE SCIENCE BEHIND SOME OF THESE CLAIMS IS UNCLEAR 
Kannada-0018-3038	IN A LOK SABHA ANSWER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE NATIONAL DAIRY RESEARCH INSTITUTE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT OXYTOCIN LED TO INFERTILITY 
Kannada-0018-3039	A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDY BY RESEARCHERS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NUTRITION CONCLUDED THAT OXYTOCIN CONTENT IN BUFFALO MILK DID NOT ALTER WITH INJECTIONS
Kannada-0018-3040	HOWEVER EVEN IF THE ILLEFFECTS OF OXYTOCIN ARE REAL A BAN IS NOT THE ANSWER 
Kannada-0018-3041	OXYTOCIN IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT TO INDIAN WOMEN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND OF WHOM DIE DUE TO CAUSES RELATED TO CHILDBIRTH EACH YEAR 
Kannada-0018-3042	A PARALLEL TO THE SITUATION LIES IN THE MISUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN HUMANS AND POULTRY 
Kannada-0018-3043	SO HEAVILY ARE THESE DRUGS USED THAT THEY ARE CAUSING DEADLY BACTERIA TO BECOME RESISTANT TO THEM 
Kannada-0018-3044	YET DESPITE CALLS FOR A COMPLETE BAN ON OVERTHECOUNTER SALE OF ANTIBIOTICS INDIA HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO SO 
Kannada-0018-3045	IN MUCH OF RURAL INDIA MORE PEOPLE STILL DIE DUE TO A LACK OF ANTIBIOTICS THAN DUE TO ANTIBIOTICRESISTANCE THIS HAS SWUNG THE COSTBENEFIT RATIO AGAINST OUTRIGHT BANS 
Kannada-0018-3046	IN OXYTOCINS CASE IF ONLY A SINGLE PUBLIC SECTOR UNIT MANUFACTURES THE DRUG AS THE GOVERNMENT PLANS THIS COULD LEAD TO DRUG SHORTAGES AND PRICE HIKES
Kannada-0018-3047	KARNATAKA ANTIBIOTICS AND PHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED THE DRUGMAKER TASKED WITH MANUFACTURING OXYTOCIN HAS BEEN ASKED TO CAP THE PRICE AT SIXTEEN RUPEES FOR ONE MILLI LITRE OF A FIVE INTERNATIONAL UNIT SOLUTION

Kannada-0018-3049	MONOPOLISING PRODUCTION WILL REMOVE THE LOWPRICE OPTIONS FROM THE MARKET

Kannada-0018-3051	SMALL SHOPS BASEMENTS TIN SHEDS AND GODOWNS 
Kannada-0018-3052	THESE ARE NOT RANDOM WORKPLACES BUT PLACES WHERE PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING INSTITUTES ARE RUNNING IN THE COUNTRY 
Kannada-0018-3053	DISTURBING FACTS SUCH AS THESE COME FROM THE REPORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON LABOUR HEADED BY BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY MP KIRIT SOMAIYA 
Kannada-0018-3054	ON THE INDUSTRIAL TRAINING INSTITUTES AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE SCHEME OF THE MINISTRY OF SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
Kannada-0018-3055	IT WAS SUBMITTED TO PARLIAMENT FEW MONTHS AGO
Kannada-0018-3056	WHAT EXPLAINS THIS HUGE PRIVATE SECTOR SCALEUP THE COMMITTEE SAYS THAT IT IS NOT EFFICIENCY BUT A DISREGARD FOR NORMS AND STANDARDS 
Kannada-0018-3057	HOWEVER THE ITIS ARE NOT ALONE THE NATIONAL SKILL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TODAY HAS MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PRIVATE TRAINING CENTRES 
Kannada-0018-3058	SINCE IT HAS SHORTTERM COURSES AND ITS CENTRES OPEN AND CLOSE FREQUENTLY IT IS ALL THE MORE PRONE TO A DILUTION OF STANDARDS 
Kannada-0018-3059	PRIVATE TRAINING PARTNERS HAVE MUSHROOMED AT THE RATE OF FIVE A DAY MOSTLY WITH GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
Kannada-0018-3060	IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REGULATE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS FOR QUALITY 
Kannada-0018-3061	THESE THINGS GAVE GREAT UNEASINESS TO TORY CHURCHMEN 
Kannada-0018-3062	NOR WERE THE MOST RESPECTABLE ROMAN CATHOLIC NOBLEMEN MUCH BETTER PLEASED 
Kannada-0018-3063	THEY MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN EXCUSED IF PASSION HAD AT THIS CONJUNCTURE MADE THEM DEAF TO THE VOICE OF PRUDENCE AND JUSTICE FOR THEY HAD SUFFERED MUCH
Kannada-0018-3064	PROTESTANT JEALOUSY HAD DEGRADED THEM FROM THE RANK TO WHICH THEY WERE BORN HAD CLOSED THE DOORS OF THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE ON THE HEIRS OF BARONS WHO HAD SIGNED THE CHARTER 
Kannada-0018-3065	HAD PRONOUNCED THE COMMAND OF A COMPANY OF FOOT TOO HIGH A TRUST FOR THE DESCENDANTS OF THE GENERALS WHO HAD CONQUERED AT FLODDEN AND SAINT QUENTIN

Kannada-0018-3069	BUT NEITHER FANATICISM NOR AMBITION NEITHER RESENTMENT FOR PAST WRONGS NOR THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE 
Kannada-0018-3070	COULD PREVENT THE MOST EMINENT ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM PERCEIVING THAT THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY AT LENGTH ENJOYED WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND UNLESS WISELY USED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THEM 
Kannada-0018-3071	THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE 
Kannada-0018-3072	BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
Kannada-0018-3073	IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS 
Kannada-0018-3074	IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT TO OBTAIN FROM THE PARLIAMENT A REPEAL OF THE ACTS WHICH IMPOSED CIVIL DISABILITIES ON THOSE WHO PROFESSED HIS RELIGION 
Kannada-0018-3075	BUT IF HE ATTEMPTED TO SUBDUE THE PROTESTANT FEELING OF ENGLAND BY RUDE MEANS

Kannada-0020-3122	THE OTHER CENTRAL MINISTRIES CONDUCTING TRAINING GEL SEAMLESSLY AND CAN LEARN FROM AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER

Kannada-0020-3127	THERE IS ALSO A CRITICAL NEED TO RESKILL ITI TEACHERS AND MAINTAIN THE STUDENTTEACHER RATIO
Kannada-0020-3128	 SINCE TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IS A CONTINUOUS CHALLENGE FINANCIAL SUPPORT ENVISAGED THROUGH THE NSDC SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO THE ITIS
Kannada-0020-3129	THE PRIMARY REASON FOR HIRING THE QCI AND THE MESS THAT FOLLOWED WAS THIS HUGE WORKLOAD OF AFFILIATION AND SHORTAGE OF STAFF 
Kannada-0020-3130	THIS IS TRUE EVEN TODAY IT IS UNLIKELY THAT WITHOUT FIXING THIS THE QCI MISTAKE WILL NOT BE REPEATED 
Kannada-0020-3131	THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PUSH BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR TALENT IN GOVERNMENT 
Kannada-0020-3132	PERHAPS IT IS WORTH CONSIDERING TALENT FROM THE OPEN MARKET TO FILL UP HIGHER POSTS IN SKILL DEVELOPMENT
Kannada-0020-3133	INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS SUCH AS MOVING THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF EMPLOYMENT THE ARM THAT HAS ALL DATA ON EMPLOYMENT FROM THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR TO THE MSDE WOULD HELP 
Kannada-0020-3134	IT WOULD ALSO COMPLEMENT THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF TRAINING ALREADY UNDER MSDE
Kannada-0020-3135	THIS IS THE LAST BUT PERENNIAL CHALLENGE GIVEN THE SCALE OF OUR DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGE A BELIEF THAT FINANCING FROM CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Kannada-0020-3136	MULTILATERAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL MEET THE FINANCIAL NEEDS FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT IS WISHFUL THINKING
Kannada-0020-3137	THE ONLY WAY TO MOBILISE ADEQUATE RESOURCES THE RIGHT WAY IS TO DO SKILLS TRAINING AND HAVE EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS 
Kannada-0020-3138	THAT KEEP PACE WITH CHANGING NEEDS AND ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME THIS IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A REIMBURSABLE INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTION
Kannada-0020-3139	 A ONE TO TWO PERCENT PAYROLL TAX THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED WHEN EMPLOYERS TRAIN USING PUBLIC PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDE DATA 
Kannada-0020-3140	RIC WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED IN SIXTY TWO OTHER COUNTRIES WAS RECOMMENDED IN THE TWELVETH PLAN AND IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME

Kannada-0020-3145	HE WROTE TO HIS MISTRESS ENTREATING HER TO QUIT THE APARTMENTS WHICH SHE OCCUPIED AT WHITEHALL 
Kannada-0020-3146	AND TO GO TO AVHOUSE IN SAINT JAMESS SQUARE WHICH HAD BEEN SPLENDIDLY FURNISHED FOR HER AT HIS EXPENSE

Kannada-0023-3244	THE TWO CASES ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT BUT GIVEN THAT THE MAIN CASE AGAINST FORMER UNION COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER DAYANIDHI MARAN RELATING TO THE AIRCELMAXIS INVESTMENT 
Kannada-0023-3245	WAS THROWN OUT AT THE PRETRIAL STAGE BY THE SPECIAL COURT THE CBI HAS A GREATER BURDEN OF PROOF TO DISCHARGE 
Kannada-0023-3246	MR CHIDAMBARAM HAS MAINTAINED THERE WAS NOTHING AMISS ABOUT THE FIPB APPROVAL WHICH WAS GIVEN ONLY AFTER BEING PROCESSED AT VARIOUS LEVELS 
Kannada-0023-3247	IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE AGENCY TO PROVE THAT THE AIRCELMAXIS INVESTMENT SUPPOSEDLY WORTH RUPEES TWO HUNDREDS CRORE 
Kannada-0023-3248	ACTUALLY HAD A VALUE OF RUPEES THREE THOUSANDS CRORE IF THE PREMIUM ATTACHED TO IT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
Kannada-0023-3249	IT ALSO HAS TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN THE FIPB APPROVAL AND SOME PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY COMPANIES SAID TO BE CONTROLLED BY MR KARTI

Kannada-0025-3350	SIR EDWARD PUBLICLY APOSTATIZED AND WAS REWARDED WITH THE COMMAND OF A REGIMENT OF FOOT
Kannada-0025-3351	HE HAD HELD HIS COMMISSION MORE THAN THREE MONTHS WITHOUT TAKING THE SACRAMENT 
Kannada-0025-3352	HE WAS THEREFORE LIABLE TO A PENALTY OF FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH AN INFORMER MIGHT RECOVER BY ACTION OF DEBT

Kannada-0026-3360	THE SUPREME COURT ORDER CALLING FOR A SPECIAL LAW TO DEAL WITH LYNCHING SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE ABOUT THE GROWING PHENOMENON OF MOB VIOLENCE 
Kannada-0026-3361	FROM VIGILANTE VIOLENCE TARGETING CATTLE TRADERS IN THE NAME OF COW PROTECTION IT HAS TAKEN A NEW TURN 
Kannada-0026-3362	WHILE THE FORMER WAS ORGANISED VIGILANTISM THE RECENT SPATE OF KILLINGS SEEMINGLY COMPRISES IMPULSIVE AND UNPLANNED ACTS OF VIOLENCE FUELLED BY RUMOUR AND PANICINDUCING SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING 
Kannada-0026-3363	LAST YEAR THE APEX COURT REMINDED THE CENTRE AND THE STATES THEY CANNOT REMAIN SILENT WHILE VIGILANTES TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IN THE NAME OF COW PROTECTION 
Kannada-0026-3364	IT ASKED ALL STATES TO APPOINT NODAL OFFICERS IN EACH DISTRICT TO CURB MOBS 
Kannada-0026-3365	WHILE THE INCIDENCE OF LYNCHING AND VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY SELFSTYLED GAU RAKSHAKS APPEAR TO HAVE REDUCED 
Kannada-0026-3366	SINCE THEN THE KILLING AND ATTACKS ON THOSE MISTAKEN TO BE CHILDKIDNAPPERS HAVE HAD A DISQUIETING RISE 
Kannada-0026-3367	THE POLICE SAY THE CIRCULATION OF VIDEOS AND OTHER MESSAGES ABOUT CHILDLIFTERS THROUGH MESSAGING APPS IS THE MAIN REASON 
Kannada-0026-3368	IN ITS FORTY FIVEPAGE ORDER THE SUPREME COURT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOCATED LYNCHING AND VIGILANTE VIOLENCE IN A SOCIOPOLITICAL FRAMEWORK LINKED TO DISRESPECT FOR AN INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ORDER RISING INTOLERANCE AND GROWING POLARISATION 
Kannada-0026-3369	THERE IS AN IMPLICIT INDICTMENT OF THE PREPONDERANT MOOD OF THE TIMES WHEN IT SAYS THAT HATE CRIMES AS A PRODUCT OF INTOLERANCE IDEOLOGICAL DOMINANCE AND PREJUDICE OUGHT NOT TO BE TOLERATED
Kannada-0026-3370	IN THIS FILE PICTURE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL IN NEW DELHI IN MEMORY OF A LYNCHING VICTIM
Kannada-0026-3371	BESIDES DIRECTING SPECIFIC PREVENTIVE PUNITIVE AND REMEDIAL MEASURES A THREEJUDGE BENCH HEADED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA HAS MOOTED THE IDEA OF MAKING LYNCHING A SEPARATE OFFENCE 
Kannada-0026-3372	IT SAYS A SPECIAL LAW WOULD INSTIL A SENSE OF FEAR AMONG THOSE INVOLVED 
Kannada-0026-3373	WHETHER A SPECIAL LAW IS ENOUGH TO ENSURE A GREATER LEVEL OF DETERRENCE IS OPEN TO QUESTION ESPECIALLY SO WHEN MURDER AND MOB VIOLENCE ARE COVERED BY EXISTING PROVISIONS 
Kannada-0026-3374	BUT IN SENDING THIS MESSAGE OUT THE APEX COURT HAS ENSURED THAT THE ISSUE CANNOT BE BRUSHED UNDER THE CARPET AND IPSO FACTO 
Kannada-0026-3375	HAS FORCED THOSE WHO GOVERN US TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TOWARDS CURBING THIS MADNESS
Kannada-0026-3376	ANY LEGISLATION THOUGH SHOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE COVERING NOT ONLY INCIDENTS OF LYNCHING 
Kannada-0026-3377	BUT ALSO THE EXTENT TO WHICH CRIMINALITY CAN BE APPORTIONED AMONG RUMOURMONGERS INSTIGATORS PRINCIPAL OFFENDERS AND THOSE WHO ARE ACCESSORIES TO THE CRIME 
Kannada-0026-3378	WHETHER IT MUST PENALISE AND IF SO HOW THOSE WHO DO NOTHING TO STOP SUCH CRIMES OR HELP BRING THE OFFENDERS TO BOOK IS ANOTHER ISSUE WORTH CONSIDERING 
Kannada-0026-3379	THE JUDGMENT PLACES THE ONUS ON THE LAW AND ORDER MACHINERY TO PREVENT AND PUNISH LYNCHINGS 
Kannada-0026-3380	BUT WE MUST HEED WHAT IT SAYS ON THE ROLE OF BIGOTRY NONACCEPTANCE OF PLURALITY AND DIVERSITY IN CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE HUMAN BEINGS ARE DEHUMANISED

Kannada-0026-3389	THE KING MIGHT LAWFULLY DISPENSE WITH PENAL STATUTES IN PARTICULAR CASES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE 
Kannada-0026-3390	THE SINGLE DISSENTIENT BARON STREET WAS NOT REMOVED FROM HIS PLACE 
Kannada-0026-3391	HE WAS A MAN OF MORALS SO BAD THAT HIS OWN RELATIONS SHRANK FROM HIM 
Kannada-0026-3392	AND THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION WAS ADVISED NOT TO SEE HIM 
Kannada-0026-3393	THE CHARACTER OF STREET MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN HIS BRETHREN 
Kannada-0026-3394	THE CHARACTER OF JAMES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT A REFRACTORY BARON OF THE EXCHEQUER WOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO RETAIN HIS POST 
Kannada-0026-3395	THERE CAN BE NO REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THE DISSENTING JUDGE WAS LIKE THE PLAINTIFF AND THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL ACTING COLLUSIVELY 
Kannada-0026-3396	IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A GREAT PREPONDERANCE OF AUTHORITY IN FAVOUR OF THE DISPENSING POWER 
Kannada-0026-3397	YET IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE BENCH WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PACKED FOR THE OCCASION SHOULD APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT

Kannada-0028-3442	HIS RITUALS OF THANKS TO INDIA AS A CIVILISATION AND TO THE INDIAN REGIME HAVE BEEN MANY 
Kannada-0028-3443	BY WELCOMING HIM TO INDIA WE ADDED TO THE SENSE OF INDIA 
Kannada-0028-3444	YET NEWSPAPERS REPORTED THAT IN THE ANNIVERSARY SPEECH HE SAID INDIA HAD MISSED A MORAL OPPORTUNITY

Kannada-0028-3446	THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS CAME OUT BOLDLY AND LITERALLY 
Kannada-0028-3447	A FEW DAYS LATER TRUE TO A SPIRIT OF CORRECTNESS THE DALAI LAMA WITHDREW HIS STATEMENT SAYING THAT HE HAD HURT FEELINGS
Kannada-0028-3448	AT A LEVEL OF FORMAL CORRECTNESS THE MATTER IS CLOSED BUT INDIA IS THE LOSER BECAUSE OUR PRICKLY SENSE OF ARROGANCE BLINDED US TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE STORY
Kannada-0028-3449	THE DALAI LAMA WAS NOT CRITICISING NEHRU HE WAS MERELY POINTING TO GLIMPSES OF HISTORY BEYOND NEHRU 
Kannada-0028-3450	HE WAS BEING THOUGHTFUL PROVOCATIVE IN A PEDAGOGIC WAY BECAUSE HE WAS CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF AND THE PEOPLE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT 
Kannada-0028-3451	AS A SPIRITUAL LEADER AND AS AN ASTUTE POLITICIAN HE WAS USING THE OCCASION TO OPEN US TO NEW POSSIBILITIES 
Kannada-0028-3452	ANYONE LIVING IN INDIA KNOWS THAT OUR SENSE OF NATIONALISM HAS BLINDED US TO ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES 
Kannada-0028-3453	WE CONCEIVE OF HISTORY AS A FAIT ACCOMPLI AND WITH A DOSE OF FATALISM
Kannada-0028-3454	YET WHAT THE DALAI LAMA IS POINTING OUT IS THAT WHAT WE SAW AS A MOMENT OF CLOSURE HAD ITS OPENINGS 
Kannada-0028-3455	THE GREATNESS OF GANDHI RECOGNISED IT AND PURSUED IT WITH A DESPERATION 
Kannada-0028-3456	GANDHI TRIED TO THWART PARTITION BY OFFERING JINNAH SOMETHING HE WOULD NOT HAVE DREAMED OF
Kannada-0028-3457	GANDHI OFFERED HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF A GIANT LEADERSHIP THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING LEADER OF A JOINT INDIAPAKISTAN 
Kannada-0028-3458	INSTEAD OF PARTITION WE COULD OR COULD HAVE HAD A UNITED INDIA IT WAS AN ACT WHICH REQUIRED A SURREAL MORAL COURAGE 
Kannada-0028-3459	IT WAS AN APPEAL TO JINNAH TO GO BEYOND DIVISIVE POLITICS IT WAS ALMOST A UTOPIAN SOLUTION TO A COMMUNAL FISSURE
Kannada-0028-3460	THE DALAI LAMA SUGGESTS THAT NEHRU REFUTED SUCH A POSSIBILITY 
Kannada-0028-3461	THE HISTORIAN IN HIM MUST HAVE SEEN IT AS IMPRACTICAL THE POLITICIAN IN HIM MUST HAVE READ IT AS INSULTING WONDERING WHETHER GANDHI HAD LOST HIS SENSE OF THE BLOODY REALITY FACING INDIA
Kannada-0028-3462	JINNAH NEHRU AND MOUNTBATTEN WERE RESPONDING AT THE LEVEL OF REALPOLITIK IT IS THE LEVEL AT WHICH HISTORY TOOK PLACE AND PARTITION BECAME INEVITABLE
Kannada-0028-3463	THE DALAI LAMA UNDERSTANDS HISTORY AS A POLITICAL LEADER HE HAS AN ACUTE SENSE OF IT 
Kannada-0028-3464	BUT AS A SPIRITUAL LEADER HE IS SUGGESTING DECADES AFTER THE EVENT THAT HISTORY COULD HAVE BEEN TRANSCENDED MORALLY 
Kannada-0028-3465	THE BISHOP REQUESTED A COPY OF THE COMMISSION IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT KNOW BY WHAT AUTHORITY HE WAS THUS INTERROGATED 
Kannada-0028-3466	IF YOU MEAN SAID JEFFREYS TO DISPUTE OUR AUTHORITY I SHALL TAKE ANOTHER COURSE WITH
Kannada-0028-3467	YOU AS TO THE COMMISSION I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IT AT ALL EVENTS YOU MAY SEE IT IN ANY COFFEEHOUSE FOR A PENNY 
Kannada-0028-3468	THE INSOLENCE OF THE CHANCELLORS REPLY APPEARS TO HAVE SHOCKED THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS AND HE WAS FORCED TO MAKE SOME AWKWARD APOLOGIES 
Kannada-0028-3469	HE THEN RETURNED TO THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD STARTED 
Kannada-0028-3470	THIS HE SAID IS NOT A COURT IN WHICH WRITTEN CHARGES ARE EXHIBITED OUR PROCEEDINGS ARE SUMMARY AND BY WORD OF MOUTH THE QUESTION IS A PLAIN ONE WHY DID YOU NOT OBEY THE KING 
Kannada-0028-3471	WITH SOME DIFFICULTY COMPTON OBTAINED A BRIEF DELAY AND THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL 
Kannada-0028-3472	WHEN THE CASE HAD BEEN HEARD IT WAS EVIDENT TO ALL MEN THAT THE BISHOP HAD DONE ONLY WHAT HE WAS BOUND TO DO 
Kannada-0028-3473	THE TREASURER THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND SPRAT WERE FOR ACQUITTAL THE KINGS WRATH WAS MOVED 
Kannada-0028-3474	IT SEEMED THAT HIS ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION WOULD FAIL HIM AS HIS TORY PARLIAMENT HAD FAILED HIM 
Kannada-0028-3475	HE OFFERED ROCHESTER A SIMPLE CHOICE TO PRONOUNCE THE BISHOP GUILTY OR TO QUIT THE TREASURY 
Kannada-0028-3476	ROCHESTER WAS BASE ENOUGH TO YIELD COMPTON WAS SUSPENDED FROM ALL SPIRITUAL FUNCTIONS AND THE CHARGE OF HIS GREAT DIOCESE WAS COMMITTED TO HIS JUDGES SPRAT AND CREWE 
Kannada-0028-3477	HE CONTINUED HOWEVER TO RESIDE IN HIS PALACE AND TO RECEIVE HIS REVENUES 
Kannada-0028-3478	FOR IT WAS KNOWN THAT HAD ANY ATTEMPT BEEN MADE TO DEPRIVE HIM OF HIS TEMPORALITIES 
Kannada-0028-3479	HE WOULD HAVE PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMON LAW AND HERBERT HIMSELF DECLARED THAT AT COMMON LAW JUDGMENT MUST BE GIVEN AGAINST THE CROWN

Kannada-0029-3480	HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT GANDHI HAD THE MORAL IMAGINATION TO GIFT JINNAH A STUNNING POSSIBILITY HE WAS MERELY ASKING JINNAH TO MOVE BEYOND HIS PETTINESS 
Kannada-0029-3481	HE WAS ASKING NEHRU FOR A SACRIFICE BEYOND ALL HIS CALIBRE AND SACRIFICES LOOKING BACK ONE CANNOT DISCOUNT THE POWER OF THIS POSSIBILITY 
Kannada-0029-3482	IN A FUTURISTIC SENSE IT MIGHT BE INDIAS GREATEST GIFT TO PAKISTAN A VISION OF A UNITED NATION

Kannada-0029-3485	POSSIBILITIES SOUND STUPENDOUS AND THE THINKER IS ALMOST GIDDY 
Kannada-0029-3486	THE DALAI LAMA IS MERELY INVOKING GANDHIS PLEA A PLEA THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED TWO GENOCIDES 
Kannada-0029-3487	HE IS NOT CONDEMNING NEHRU HE IS ONLY SAYING THAT GANDHIS MORAL IMAGINATION TRANSCENDED THE CONVENTIONAL GRIDS OF HISTORYTHE DALAI LAMAS COMMENTARY IS TIMELY 
Kannada-0029-3488	HE IS ASKING A JINGOISTIC NATION STATE TO THINK OUT OF THE BOX AND CREATE A SITUATION WHERE THE ETHICAL IS EXPERIMENTAL AND THEOLOGY GOES BEYOND MERE PATRIOTIC CATECHISM
Kannada-0029-3489	THE DALAI LAMA AS A GREAT TEACHER IS NOT ONLY REFERRING TO A PAST AS A FORGOTTEN FRAGMENT BUT HE IS ALSO REFERRING TO THE PRESENT AND SUGGESTING THAT THE GANDHIAN CONUNDRUM HAS DESPERATE RELEVANCE TODAY 
Kannada-0029-3490	IT COULD BECOME THE SPIRITUAL TURNINGPOINT FOR RETHINKING KASHMIR OR EVEN ASSAM I AM SURE HE KNOWS THAT HISTORY CANNOT BE REVERSED 
Kannada-0029-3491	I FEEL THAT LIKE A ZEN MONK HE IS IRONICALLY TRAGICALLY ASKING IF HISTORY HAS TO BE REPEATED SO THAT GENOCIDE BECOMES AN EVERYDAY WAY OF LIFE 
Kannada-0029-3492	NEHRU AND GANDHI WOULD HAVE GRASPED THE POINT I AM NOT QUITE SURE THAT THE CURRENT REGIME PEDDLING PATRIOTISM AS A COMMODITY WOULD
Kannada-0029-3493	ONE MUST THANK THE DALAI LAMA FOR HIS COURAGE AND THE SHEER RELEVANCE OF HIS STORY 
Kannada-0029-3494	EXILE ALONG WITH SPIRITUALITY MAKES HIS COMPASSION MORE HARDHEADED 
Kannada-0029-3495	HE IS SEEKING IMAGINATIONS BEYOND THE CURRENT CONVENTIONS OF THOUGHT 
Kannada-0029-3496	THERE IS A SEARCH FOR A REALISM WHICH GOES BEYOND THE HARDHEARTED NATIONALISM OF TODAY 
Kannada-0029-3497	HE IS SUGGESTING THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE LIVING ON SURVEILLANCE IS TOO ARID A CONCEPT COMPASSION OPENS MINDS AND OPENS US TO THE MIND OF THE OTHER 
Kannada-0029-3498	HIS WAS NOT A KNEEJERK CRITIQUE OF NEHRU BUT HE WAS IMAGINING A NEHRU BEYOND THE CURRENT PANTHEONS OF NEHRU AMBUSHING HISTORY INSTEAD OF BEING AMBUSHED BY IT
Kannada-0029-3499	A NEHRU WHO COULD HAVE JUMPSTARTED AN UNBELIEVABLE ERA OF HISTORY 
Kannada-0029-3500	WE COULD HAVE HAD AN ALTERNATIVE POLITY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPERIMENT IN PLURALISTIC FEDERALISM 
Kannada-0029-3501	ALL THE DALAI LAMA IS SUGGESTING IS THAT A PLAYFUL CIVILISATION LIKE INDIA MUST NOT BE A BLINDED NATION STATE 
Kannada-0029-3502	HE IS OPENING US TO IDEAS THAT ARE FUTURISTIC AND LIFESAVING I THINK INDIA NEEDS TO REMASTER THE ART OF LISTENING THE ACUTENESS OF DEBATE AND DISCOURSE FROM OUR SPIRITUAL PAST 
Kannada-0029-3503	WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THE DALAI LAMA HE WAS NOT INSULTING US OR OUR HOSPITALITY IN FACT HE WAS REPAYING IT WITH GRATITUDE WITH LAUGHTER AND HUMOUR WITH SINCERITY
Kannada-0029-3504	THE QUESTION IS WILL INDIA RESPOND ALL HE IS SUGGESTING IS THE CIVILISATIONAL CREATIVITY INDIA SHOWED TO TIBETANS AS HONOURED REFUGEES NOW BE APPLIED TO ASSAM THE ROHINGYA

Kannada-0029-3511	A REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR HISDETECTION HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GENERAL RULE THAT MEN ARE NOT BOUND TO ACCUSE THEMSELVES 
Kannada-0029-3512	WHOEVER WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING A JESUIT MIGHT BE INTERROGATED AND IF HE REFUSED TO ANSWER MIGHT BE SENT TO PRISON FOR LIFE 
Kannada-0029-3513	THESE LAWS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT EXCEPT WHEN THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME PECULIAR DANGER BEEN STRICTLY EXECUTED 
Kannada-0029-3514	AND THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER PREVENTED JESUITS FROM RESORTING TO ENGLAND HAD MADE DISGUISE NECESSARY 
Kannada-0029-3515	BUT ALL DISGUISE WAS NOW THROWN OFF INJUDICIOUS MEMBERS OF THE KINGS CHURCH ENCOURAGED BY HIM TOOK A PRIDE IN DEFYING STATUTES 
Kannada-0029-3516	WHICH WERE STILL OF UNDOUBTED VALIDITY AND FEELINGS WHICH HAD A STRONGER HOLD OF THE NATIONAL MIND THAN AT ANY FORMER PERIOD 
Kannada-0029-3517	ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPELS ROSE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY COWLS GIRDLES OF ROPES AND STRINGS OF BEADS CONSTANTLY APPEARED IN THE STREETS 
Kannada-0029-3518	AND ASTONISHED A POPULATION THE OLDEST OF WHOM HAD NEVER SEEN A CONVENTUAL GARB EXCEPT ON THE STAGE 
Kannada-0029-3519	A CONVENT ROSE AT CLERKENWELL ON THE SITE OF THE ANCIENT CLOISTER OF SAINT JOHN 
Kannada-0029-3520	THE FRANCISCANS OCCUPIED A MANSION IN LINCOLNS INN FIELDS THE CARMELITES WERE QUARTERED IN THE CITY 
Kannada-0029-3521	A SOCIETY OF BENEDICTINE MONKS WAS LODGED IN SAINT JAMESS PALACE IN THE SAVOY A SPACIOUS HOUSE INCLUDING A CHURCH AND A SCHOOL WAS BUILT FOR THE JESUITS

Kannada-0034-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0034-3682	THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE YEAR BEFORE THE ELECTIONS 
Kannada-0034-3683	AS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR WE HAVE DATA FOR THE INDEX OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER 
Kannada-0034-3684	THEY SHOW SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR 
Kannada-0034-3685	IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE IIP AND NATIONAL INCOME DATA ON MANUFACTURING IS POOR 
Kannada-0034-3686	SOME SECTORS AUTOMOBILES AND RAILWAY FREIGHT TRAFFIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER HAVE DONE WELL 
Kannada-0034-3687	THE COMBINED REVENUES AND PROFIT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LARGE COMPANIES HAVE SHOWN BETTER PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ON A WEAK BASE 
Kannada-0034-3688	THE PROBLEMS OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX MAY HAVE BEEN LARGELY OVERCOME BUT IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS A PICKUP IN THE GROWTH RATE IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS LIKELY
Kannada-0034-3689	LOOKING AT THE OVERALL GDP AFTER SEVERAL QUARTERS OF LOW GROWTH THERE WAS A STRONG PICKUP IN THE LAST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEENEIGHTEEN 
Kannada-0034-3690	IF THIS MOMENTUM IS MAINTAINED THE GROWTH RATE WILL CERTAINLY BE ABOVE SEVEN PERCENT
Kannada-0034-3691	HOW MUCH HIGHER ABOVE SEVEN PERCENT WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE FORECAST A GROWTH RATE OF SEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT 
Kannada-0034-3692	THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA EXPECTS IT TO BE SEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
Kannada-0034-3693	HOWEVER WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE OF CERTAIN CONCERNS THAT CAN COME IN THE WAY OF FASTER GROWTH
Kannada-0034-3694	THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IS FAR FROM REASSURING TRADE WARS HAVE ALREADY STARTED AND CAN GET WORSE 
Kannada-0034-3695	THE US HAS RAISED DUTIES ON SEVERAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS STEEL AND ALUMINIUM AND ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA 
Kannada-0034-3696	IN TURN CHINA HAS RETALIATED INDIA HAS ALSO BEEN CAUGHT IN THIS EXCHANGE IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST HOW MUCH WORSE THIS WILL BECOME 
Kannada-0034-3697	BESIDES THESE THERE ARE COUNTRYSPECIFIC SANCTIONS SUCH AS THOSE AGAINST IRAN WHICH HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON CRUDE OIL OUTPUT AND PRICES 
Kannada-0034-3698	INDIA BENEFITED FROM THE FALL IN CRUDE PRICES EARLIER BUT THIS POSITION HAS REVERSED THERE HAS BEEN SOME LULL IN CRUDE PRICES 
Kannada-0034-3699	AS A NET IMPORTER INDIAS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS CAN TAKE A BEATING IF CRUDE PRICES RISE AGAIN
Kannada-0034-3700	IN THIS CONTEXT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE RUPEE DOES NOT APPRECIATE IN REAL TERMS 
Kannada-0034-3701	DESPITE A CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT INDIAS RUPEE HAD REMAINED STRONG BECAUSE OF CAPITAL FLOWS
Kannada-0034-3702	WITH A RISING TRADE DEFICIT AND SOME OUTFLOW OF CAPITAL THE RUPEE HAS DEPRECIATED THIS IS NOT UNNATURAL 
Kannada-0034-3703	THE RBI SHOULD ACT ONLY TO ENSURE THAT THE ADJUSTMENT IS SMOOTH AND THERE ARE NO VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS 
Kannada-0034-3704	BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO MAKE OUR EXPORTS COMPETITIVE THE EXCHANGE RATE IS ONLY ONE ELEMENT 
Kannada-0034-3705	IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCTION AND BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT
Kannada-0034-3706	MAINTENANCE OF DOMESTIC STABILITY ALSO PLAYS A KEY ROLE OVER THE MEDIUM TERM WE NEED TO SEARCH FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FUELTHE BANKING SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE A SOURCE OF CONCERN 
Kannada-0034-3707	IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER LONDON THAT THE BISHOPS WERE BEFORE THE COUNCIL 
Kannada-0034-3708	THE PUBLIC ANXIETY WAS INTENSE A GREAT MULTITUDE FILLED THE COURTS OF WHITEHALL AND ALL THE NEIGHBOURING STREETS 
Kannada-0034-3709	MANY PEOPLE WERE IN THE HABIT OF REFRESHING THEMSELVES AT THE CLOSE OF A SUMMER DAY WITH THE COOL AIR OF THE THAMESBUT ON THIS EVENING THE WHOLE RIVER WAS ALIVE WITH WHERRIES 
Kannada-0034-3710	WHEN THE SEVEN CAME FORTH UNDER A GUARD THE EMOTIONS OF THE PEOPLE BROKE THROUGH ALL RESTRAINT 
Kannada-0034-3711	THOUSANDS FELL ON THEIR KNEES AND PRAYED ALOUD FOR THE MEN WHO HAD WITH THE CHRISTIAN COURAGE OF RIDLEY AND LATIMER CONFRONTED A TYRANT INFLAMED BY ALL THE BIGOTRY OF MARY 
Kannada-0034-3712	MANY DASHED INTO THE STREAM AND UP TO THEIR WAISTS IN OOZE AND WATER CRIED TO THE HOLY FATHERS TO BLESS THEM 
Kannada-0034-3713	ALL DOWN THE RIVER FROM WHITEHALL TO LONDON BRIDGE THE ROYAL BARGE PASSED BETWEEN LINES OF BOATS FROM WHICH AROSE A SHOUT OF GOD BLESS YOUR LORDSHIPS 
Kannada-0034-3714	THE KING IN GREAT ALARM GAVE ORDERS THAT THE GARRISON OF THE TOWER SHOULD BE DOUBLED THAT THE GUARDS SHOULD BE HELD READY FOR ACTION 
Kannada-0034-3715	AND THAT TWO COMPANIES SHOULD BE DETACHED FROM EVERY REGIMENT IN THE KINGDOM AND SENT UP INSTANTLY TO LONDON 
Kannada-0034-3716	BUT THE FORCE ON WHICH HE RELIED AS THE MEANS OF COERCING THE PEOPLE SHARED ALL THE FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE 
Kannada-0034-3717	THE VERY SENTINELS WHO WERE UNDER ARMS AT THE TRAITORS GATE REVERENTLY ASKED FOR A BLESSING FROM THE MARTYRS WHOM THEY WERE TO GUARD 
Kannada-0034-3718	SIR EDWARD HALES WAS LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER HE WAS LITTLE INCLINED TO TREAT HIS PRISONERS WITH KINDNESS 
Kannada-0034-3719	FOR HE WAS AN APOSTATE FROM THAT CHURCH FOR WHICH THEY SUFFEREDAND HE HELD SEVERAL LUCRATIVE POSTS BY VIRTUE OF THAT DISPENSING POWER AGAINST WHICH THEY HAD PROTESTED 
Kannada-0034-3720	HE LEARNED WITH INDIGNATION THAT HIS SOLDIERS WERE DRINKING THE HEALTH OF THE BISHOPSHE ORDERED HIS OFFICERS TO SEE THAT IT WAS DONE NO MORE 
Kannada-0034-3721	BUT THE OFFICERS CAME BACK WITH A REPORT THAT THE THING COULD NOT BE PREVENTED AND THAT NO OTHER HEALTH WAS DRUNK IN THE GARRISON 
Kannada-0034-3722	NOR WAS IT ONLY BY CAROUSING THAT THE TROOPS SHOWED THEIR REVERENCE FOR THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH

Kannada-0036-3764	THE EXPECTED GROWTH RATE OF SEVEN PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT MAY BE REASSURING 
Kannada-0036-3765	IT MAY EVEN BE THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD ECONOMY NEVERTHELESS IT FALLS SHORT OF OUR POTENTIAL 
Kannada-0036-3766	IT IS BELOW OF WHAT IS NEEDED TO RAISE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND REDUCE POVERTY IT IS TRUE THAT THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT HELPFUL 
Kannada-0036-3767	ALL THE SAME A STRONGER PUSH TOWARDS A MUCH HIGHER GROWTH IS VERY MUCH THE NEED OF THE HOUR

Kannada-0036-3769	INDIAS STOCK MARKETS ARE BOOMING WITH THE BSE SENSEX TOUCHING NEW HIGHS 
Kannada-0036-3770	THE REGULATION OF SECURITIES MARKETS HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF DECADES SINCE THE SETTING UP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA BUT IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
Kannada-0036-3771	 FRONTRUNNING INSIDER TRADING SHADY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES THAT ARE TANTAMOUNT TO WINDOWDRESSING FIRMS PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SHENANIGANS TO MANIPULATE SHARE PRICES CONTINUE 
Kannada-0036-3772	A PANEL HEADED BY TK VISWANATHAN A FORMER LOK SABHA SECRETARY GENERAL HAS NOW SUBMITTED RECOMMENDATIONS TO CURB ILLEGAL PRACTICES IN THE MARKETS AND ENSURE FAIR CONDUCT AMONG INVESTORS 
Kannada-0036-3773	A KEY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE STOCK MARKET WATCHDOG BE GRANTED THE POWER TO ACT DIRECTLY AGAINST PERPETRATORS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FRAUD 
Kannada-0036-3774	IN ESSENCE THIS MEANS SEBI CAN ACT NOT ONLY AGAINST LISTED ENTITIES UNDER ITS EXTANT POWERS BUT ALSO AGAINST THOSE WHO AID OR ABET FINANCIAL FRAUD INCLUDING ACCOUNTANTS AND AUDITORS
Kannada-0036-3775	THE PANEL HAS SUGGESTED THAT SEBI RATHER THAN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BE GIVEN THE POWER TO GRANT IMMUNITY TO WHISTLEBLOWERS WHO HELP UNCOVER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES 
Kannada-0036-3776	IT HAS MOOTED NEW IDEAS TO ADDRESS MARKET MANIPULATION FROM BETTER SCRUTINY OF PRICESENSITIVE INFORMATION TO THE CREATION OF PROCESSES TO EXPEDITE INVESTIGATION INTO CASES 
Kannada-0036-3777	IT GOES TO THE EXTENT OF RECOMMENDING THAT SEBI BE GIVEN POWERS TO TAP PHONE CALLS
Kannada-0036-3778	GREATER EXECUTIVE POWERS IT IS BEING SUGGESTED CAN HELP THE REGULATOR TAKE SWIFTER ACTION AGAINST OFFENDERS INSTEAD OF RELYING ON GOVERNMENT BODIES SUCH AS THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS 
Kannada-0036-3779	OSTENSIBLY THIS COULD ALSO FREE SEBI FROM VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
Kannada-0036-3780	SINCE SEBI IS BETTER PLACED TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX NUANCES THAT FINANCIAL MARKET FRAUD ENTAILS COMPARED TO OTHER INVESTIGATIVE AGENCIES
Kannada-0036-3781	OR EVEN THOSE IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING THE COMPANIES ACT IT MAY ALSO BE BETTER PLACED TO ENFORCE THE LAW 
Kannada-0036-3782	A STRONG REGULATOR SERVES AS A GOOD DETERRENT TO TRUANTS IN THE MARKET BUT BANKING ON FEAR TOO MUCH COULD ALSO SCARE AWAY GENUINE INVESTORS 
Kannada-0036-3783	SEBI IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MORE EFFICIENT REGULATORS BUT IT IS NOT FAULTLESS
Kannada-0036-3784	LAST YEAR ITS ORDER TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRADING OF SHARES OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE COMPANIES SUSPECTED OF LAUNDERING MONEY 
Kannada-0036-3785	IT WAS SEEN AS A HASTY MOVE TAKEN UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT A FORMAL INVESTIGATION 
Kannada-0036-3786	GIVEN THAT SEBI IS NOW CONSIDERING A CAP ON TRADING BY RETAIL INVESTORS BASED ON THEIR ASSESSED NET WORTH
Kannada-0036-3787	THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTION THAT IT MAY CONSIDER ANY TRADING BY PLAYERS BEYOND THEIR KNOWN FINANCIAL RESOURCES AS FRAUD COULD LEAD TO UNDUE HARASSMENT OF INVESTORS 
Kannada-0036-3788	GRANTING MORE TEETH TO ENABLE THE MARKET REGULATOR TO FULFIL ITS PRIMARY ROLE OF PROTECTING INVESTORS IS FINE 
Kannada-0036-3789	THAT JOYFUL DAY WAS FOLLOWED BY A NOT LESS JOYFUL NIGHT THE BISHOPS AND SOME OF THEIR MOST RESPECTABLE FRIENDS IN VAIN EXERTED THEMSELVES TO PREVENT TUMULTUOUS DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY 
Kannada-0036-3790	NEVER WITHIN THE MEMORY OF THE OLDEST NOT EVEN ON THAT EVENING ON WHICH IT WAS KNOWN THROUGH LONDON THAT THE ARMY OF SCOTLAND HAD DECLARED FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT HAD THE STREETS BEEN IN SUCH A GLARE WITH BONFIRES 
Kannada-0036-3791	ROUND EVERY BONFIRE CROWDS WERE DRINKING GOOD HEALTH TO THE BISHOPS AND CONFUSION TO THE PAPISTS 
Kannada-0036-3792	THE WINDOWS WERE LIGHTED WITH ROWS OF CANDLES EACH ROW CONSISTED OF SEVEN AND THE TAPER IN THE CENTRE WHICH WAS TALLER THAN THE REST REPRESENTED THE PRIMATE 
Kannada-0036-3793	THE NOISE OF ROCKETS SQUIBS AND FIREARMS WAS INCESSANT ONE HUGE PILE OF FAGGOTS BLAZED RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GREAT GATE OF WHITEHALL 
Kannada-0036-3794	OTHERS WERE LIGHTED BEFORE THE DOORS OF ROMAN CATHOLIC PEERS LORD ARUNDELL OF WARDOUR WISELY QUIETED THE MOB WITH A LITTLE MONEY 
Kannada-0036-3795	BUT AT SALISBURY HOUSE IN THE STRAND AN ATTEMPT AT RESISTANCE WAS MADE 
Kannada-0036-3796	LORD SALISBURYS SERVANTS SALLIED OUT AND FIRED BUT THEY KILLED ONLY THE UNFORTUNATE BEADLE OF THE PARISH WHO HAD COME THITHER TO PUT OUT THE FIREAND THEY WERE SOON ROUTED AND DRIVEN BACK INTO THE HOUSE 
Kannada-0036-3797	NONE OF THE SPECTACLES OF THAT NIGHT INTERESTED THE COMMON PEOPLE SO MUCH AS ONE WITH WHICH THEY HAD A FEW YEARS BEFORE BEEN FAMILIAR AND WHICH THEY NOW AFTER A LONG INTERVAL ENJOYED ONCE MORE THE BURNING OF THE POPE 
Kannada-0036-3798	THIS ONCE FAMILIAR PAGEANT IS KNOWN TO OUR GENERATION ONLY BY DESCRIPTIONS AND ENGRAVINGS
Kannada-0036-3799	A FIGURE BY NO MEANS RESEMBLING THOSE RUDE REPRESENTATIONS OF GUY FAUX WHICH ARE STILL PARADED ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER BUT MADE OF WAX WITH SOME SKILL 
Kannada-0036-3800	AND ADORNED AT NO SMALL EXPENSE WITH ROBES AND A TIARA WAS MOUNTED ON A CHAIR RESEMBLING THAT IN WHICH THE BISHOPS OF ROME ARE STILL ON SOME GREAT FESTIVALS BORNE THROUGH SAINT PETERS CHURCH TO THE HIGH ALTAR 
Kannada-0036-3801	HIS HOLINESS WAS GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A TRAIN OF CARDINALS AND JESUITS AT HIS EAR STOOD A BUFFOON DISGUISED AS A DEVIL WITH HORNS AND TAIL 
Kannada-0036-3802	NO RICH AND ZEALOUS PROTESTANT GRUDGED HIS GUINEA ON SUCH AN OCCASION AND IF RUMOUR COULD BE TRUSTED THE COST OF THE PROCESSION WAS SOMETIMES NOT LESS THAN A THOUSAND POUNDS 
Kannada-0036-3803	AFTER THE POPE HAD BEEN BORNE SOME TIME IN STATE OVER THE HEADS OF THE MULTITUDE HE WAS COMMITTED TO THE FLAMES WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS

Kannada-0038-3884	SINCE THEN SAUDI ARABIA HAS ALLOWED WOMEN TO DRIVE CRACKED DOWN ON HARDLINERS AMONG THE CLERGY AND PROJECTED ITSELF AS A MODERATE ISLAMIC COUNTRY
Kannada-0038-3885	BUT WHEN CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CHRYSTIA FREELAND CALLED FOR THE RELEASE OF SAMAR BADAWI A SAUDI WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVIST 
Kannada-0038-3886	WHO WAS DETAINED LAST WEEK AND HER BROTHER RAIF BADAWI RIYADH TOOK A SERIES OF UNILATERAL STEPS 
Kannada-0038-3887	TERMING MS FREELANDS APPEAL AS INTERFERENCE IN ITS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS IT EXPELLED THE CANADIAN AMBASSADOR CALLED BACK ITS ENVOY FROM OTTAWA
Kannada-0038-3888	FROZE TRADE WITH CANADA AND SAID IT WOULD TRANSFER OUT SOME TWELVE THOUSAND SAUDI CITIZENS STUDYING IN CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES
Kannada-0038-3889	MS BADAWI HAS LONG CAMPAIGNED AGAINST SAUDI ARABIAS GUARDIANSHIP LAWS THAT REQUIRE ALL SAUDI WOMEN TO HAVE A MALE GUARDIAN 
Kannada-0038-3890	RIYADH IS YET TO GIVE REASONS FOR THE ARREST HER BROTHER WHO RAN A WEBSITE CRITICAL OF THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT WAS SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS IN JAIL AND ONE THOUSAND LASHES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN
Kannada-0038-3891	ON OVERSEAS VISITS PRINCE MOHAMMED HAS DWELT ON HIS PLAN TO IMPROVE WOMENS RIGHTS AND STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY 
Kannada-0038-3892	HE IS ALSO OBLIQUELY CRITICAL OF THE GUARDIANSHIP LAWS SAYING THEY DID NOT EXIST IN SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE YEAR OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND THE SIEGE OF THE GRAND MOSQUE AT MECCA 
Kannada-0038-3893	BUT DESPITE THIS RHETORIC ON RIGHTS THE PALACE HAS SHOWN LITTLE TOLERANCE OF POLITICAL CRITICISM AT HOME 
Kannada-0038-3894	SINCE MAY MANY WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN DETAINED 
Kannada-0038-3895	IN ADDITION DOZENS OF LAWYERS HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED SINCE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN 
Kannada-0038-3896	INTERESTINGLY WHILE MOST WESTERN GOVERNMENTS REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE CRACKDOWN AGAINST DISSENT IN SAUDI ARABIA CANADA HAS GIVEN REFUGE TO MR BADAWIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
Kannada-0038-3897	FOR CANADA THE SPAT COULD PROVE COSTLY SAUDI ARABIA IS ITS SECOND LARGEST EXPORT DESTINATION IN WEST ASIA 
Kannada-0038-3898	THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED A TWELVE BILLION ARMS DEAL WHICH IS STILL IN THE WORKS 
Kannada-0038-3899	BUT DESPITE THE AGGRESSIVE SAUDI RESPONSE OTTAWA HAD STOOD BY ITS FOREIGN MINISTER SAYING IT WILL CONTINUE TO BACK THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INCLUDING WOMENS RIGHTS 
Kannada-0038-3900	FOR PRINCE MOHAMMED THE DIPLOMATIC CRISIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE KINGDOMS APPROACH TOWARDS DISSENT AND DIPLOMACY 
Kannada-0038-3901	IF HE IS INDEED SERIOUS ABOUT REFORM RIYADH SHOULD BE LENIENT TOWARDS ITS ADVOCATES 
Kannada-0038-3902	TAKING VENGEFUL ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO STAND BY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WILL NEITHER HELP SAUDI ARABIAS IMAGE NOR ATTRACT INVESTMENT INTO THE COUNTRY
Kannada-0038-3903	THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN THE COUNTRY IS FINALLY SPEEDING UP 
Kannada-0038-3904	A TASK FORCE OF THE UNION COMMERCE MINISTRY HAS SUBMITTED THE DRAFT NATIONAL POLICY ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Kannada-0038-3905	WHICH WILL NOW BE STUDIED BY A SEVENTYMEMBER THINK TANK CHAIRED BY SURESH PRABHU THE UNION COMMERCE INDUSTRY AND CIVIL AVIATION MINISTER 
Kannada-0038-3906	INDIAS ETAIL BUSINESS ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH AROUND TWENTY FIVE BILLION IS STILL A FRACTION OF THE OVERALL RETAIL SECTOR IN THE COUNTRY 
Kannada-0038-3907	BUT IT HAS BEEN WITNESS TO SOME FRENETIC ACTIVITY OF LATE INCLUDING THE MERGER BETWEEN HOMEGROWN BUT SINGAPOREBASED FLIPKART AND GLOBAL GIANT WALMART 
Kannada-0038-3908	OVER THE COMING DECADE THE ECOMMERCE PIE IS EXPECTED TO SWELL TO TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FUELLED BY SMARTPHONES CHEAPER DATA ACCESS AND GROWING SPENDS 
Kannada-0038-3909	OF THE MANY ERRORS WHICH JAMES COMMITTED NONE WAS MORE FATAL THAN THIS 
Kannada-0038-3910	ALREADY HE HAD ALIENATED THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE BY VIOLATING THEIR LAWS CONFISCATING THEIR ESTATES AND PERSECUTING THEIR RELIGION 
Kannada-0038-3911	OF THOSE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN MOST ZEALOUS FOR MONARCHY HE HAD ALREADY MADE MANY REBELS IN HEART 
Kannada-0038-3912	YET HE MIGHT STILL WITH SOME CHANCE OF SUCCESS HAVE APPEALED TO THE PATRIOTIC SPIRIT OF HIS SUBJECTS AGAINST AN INVADER 
Kannada-0038-3913	FOR THEY WERE A RACE INSULAR IN TEMPER AS WELL AS IN GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION 
Kannada-0038-3914	THEIR NATIONAL ANTIPATHIES WERE INDEED IN THAT AGE UNREASONABLY AND UNAMIABLY STRONG NEVER HAD THE ENGLISH BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTROL OF INTERFERENCE OF ANY STRANGER 
Kannada-0038-3915	THE APPEARANCE OF A FOREIGN ARMY ON THEIR SOIL MIGHT IMPEL THEM TO RALLY EVEN ROUND A KING WHOM THEY HAD NO REASON TO LOVE 
Kannada-0038-3916	WILLIAM MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY BUT JAMES REMOVED IT
Kannada-0038-3917	NOT EVEN THE ARRIVAL OF A BRIGADE OF LEWISS MUSKETEERS WOULD HAVE EXCITED SUCH RESENTMENT AND SHAME AS OUR ANCESTORS FELT WHEN THEY SAW ARMED COLUMNS OF PAPISTS 
Kannada-0038-3918	JUST ARRIVED FROM DUBLIN MOVING IN MILITARY POMP ALONG THE HIGH ROADS NO MAN OF ENGLISH BLOOD THEN REGARDED THE ABORIGINAL IRISH AS HIS COUNTRYMEN 
Kannada-0038-3919	THEY DID NOT BELONG TO OUR BRANCH OF THE GREAT HUMAN FAMILY THEY WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM US BY MORE THAN ONE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL PECULIARITY WHICH THE DIFFERENCE OF SITUATION AND OF EDUCATION GREAT AS THAT DIFFERENCE WAS DID NOT SEEM ALTOGETHER TO EXPLAIN 
Kannada-0038-3920	THEY HAD AN ASPECT OF THEIR OWN A MOTHER TONGUE OF THEIR OWN WHEN THEY TALKED ENGLISH THEIR PRONUNCIATION WAS LUDICROUS THEIR PHRASEOLOGY WAS GROTESQUE 
Kannada-0038-3921	AS IS ALWAYS THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THOSE WHO THINK IN ONE LANGUAGE AND EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS IN ANOTHER THEY WERE THEREFORE FOREIGNERS 
Kannada-0038-3922	AND OF ALL FOREIGNERS THEY WERE THE MOST HATED AND DESPISED THE MOST HATED FOR THEY HAD DURING FIVE CENTURIES ALWAYS BEEN OUR ENEMIES 
Kannada-0038-3923	THE MOST DESPISED FOR THEY WERE OUR VANQUISHED ENSLAVED AND DESPOILED ENEMIES

Kannada-0041-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0041-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0041-4005	BUT WITHOUT A COHERENT POLITICAL PROPOSITION THERE IS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM MERE OPPORTUNISM 
Kannada-0041-4006	AND SO FAR THE CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO OFFER ANYTHING MORE THAN OPPORTUNISTIC ATTACKS ON PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODIS VARIOUS BLUNDERS
Kannada-0041-4007	FROM DEMONETISATION TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX AND THE RAFALE DEAL 
Kannada-0041-4008	THE IDEA SEEMS TO BE TO HAMMER AWAY AT HIS FAILURES AND HOPE THAT ANTIINCUMBENCY DOES THE REST
Kannada-0041-4009	MERE ANTIBJPISM OR ANTIMODIISM IS JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH EITHER TO HOLD THE OPPOSITION TOGETHER OR TO DEFEAT THE BJP IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN 
Kannada-0041-4010	TO STAND A FIGHTING CHANCE OF ACHIEVING EITHER THE ALLIANCE MUST ADDRESS A GENUINE POLITICAL NEED GAP AND IN THE CURRENT JUNCTURE
Kannada-0041-4011	THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE IS THE ABSENCE OF A PLATFORM AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL FOR CONSTITUENCIES WHOSE INTERESTS CANNOT BE SERIOUSLY REPRESENTED BY THE BJP
Kannada-0041-4012	GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE POLITICS IT ESPOUSES 
Kannada-0041-4013	THESE CONSTITUENCIES ARE THE SOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INVERSE OF THE BJPS CORE ELECTORAL BASE
Kannada-0041-4014	WHICH CONSISTS OF THE SAVARNAS FORWARD CASTES AND THE URBAN MIDDLE AND UPPER CLASSES PRIMARILY FROM THE HINDISPEAKING BELT
Kannada-0041-4015	ASSUMING THAT THE BASE OF MATERIAL INTERESTS AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION DETERMINE THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS
Kannada-0041-4016	TRADITIONALLY INDIAS HINDISPEAKING SAVARNA ELITE HAVE EITHER DIRECTED OR DEMARCATED THE POLITICS OF THE NATIONAL PARTIES INCLUDING THE LEFT FRONT 
Kannada-0041-4017	BUT ITS HEGEMONIC RELATIONSHIP WITH NONSAVARNA AND REGIONAL INTERESTS HAS SO FAR BEEN TEMPERED BY THE CONSTITUTION
Kannada-0041-4018	THE VERY DOCUMENT THAT IS NOW IN DANGER OF BEING UNDERMINED 
Kannada-0041-4019	THE CONSTITUTION OFFERS TWO PRINCIPLES FOR NAVIGATING THIS HEGEMONY DEMOCRATICALLY SOCIAL JUSTICE AND FEDERALISM
Kannada-0041-4020	BOTH OF WHICH THE MODI GOVERNMENT HAS OBSERVED MORE IN THE BREACH AS EVIDENCED BY THE DISAFFECTION AMONG ITS ALLIES
Kannada-0041-4021	WHILE THE LOK JANSHAKTI PARTY HAD THREATENED TO JOIN THE ANTIGOVERNMENT DALIT PROTESTS SCHEDULED FOR AUGUST 9
Kannada-0041-4022	THE TELUGU DESAM PARTY AND THE PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE ALREADY OUT OF THE NDA
Kannada-0041-4023	ANOTHER REGIONAL ALLY THE SHIV SENA HAS THREATENED TO GO IT ALONE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN 
Kannada-0041-4024	CLEARLY THERE ARE LIMITS TO HOW MUCH THE BJP CAN ACCOMMODATE NONSAVARNA AND REGIONAL INTERESTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL
Kannada-0041-4025	THE CONGRESS TOO SUFFERS FROM THE SAME LIMITATION AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FACTORS BEHIND ITS INTERMINABLE DECLINE 
Kannada-0041-4026	THE SAVARNAS HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD THE BIGGEST STAKES IN THE NATIONAL PROJECT AND THE INDIAN STATE AND HAVE ALSO BEEN ITS BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES 
Kannada-0041-4027	IT IS THUS NO COINCIDENCE THAT NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE NONSAVARNA PARTIES INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE A NATIONAL STATUS SUCH AS THE BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY HAVE A NATIONAL FOOTPRINT 
Kannada-0041-4028	NOR IS IT ACCIDENTAL THAT ONLY THE REGIONALIST PARTIES COULD RESIST THE BJP JUGGERNAUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN
Kannada-0041-4029	AND AGAIN IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT FOUR YEARS OF MR MODIS RULE HAVE SEEN A STEADY SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE CENTRE AND THE STATES IN FAVOUR OF THE FORMER 
Kannada-0041-4030	THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTIES WERE VIOLENTLY AGITATED IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED THAT DANBY SHOULD SEIZE YORK AND THAT DEVONSHIRE SHOULD APPEAR AT NOTTINGHAM 
Kannada-0041-4031	AT NOTTINGHAM NO RESISTANCE WAS ANTICIPATED BUT AT YORK THERE WAS A SMALL GARRISON UNDER THE COMMAND OF SIR JOHN ROBERT 
Kannada-0041-4032	DANBY ACTED WITH RARE DEXTERITY A MEETING OF THE GENTRY AND FREEHOLDERS OF YORKSHIRE HAD BEEN SUMMONED FOR THE TWENTYSECOND OF NOVEMBER TO ADDRESS THE KING ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS 
Kannada-0041-4033	ALL THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF THE THREE RIDINGS SEVERAL NOBLEMEN AND A MULTITUDE OF OPULENT ESQUIRES AND SUBSTANTIAL MEN HAD BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL 
Kannada-0041-4034	FOUR TROOPS OF MILITIA HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT UNDER ARMS TO PRESERVE THE PUBLIC PEACE 
Kannada-0041-4035	THE COMMON HALL WAS CROWDED WITH FREEHOLDERS AND THE DISCUSSION HAD BEGUN WHEN A CRY WAS SUDDENLY RAISED THAT THE PAPISTS WERE UP AND WERE SLAYING THE PROTESTANTS 
Kannada-0041-4036	THE PAPISTS OF YORK WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED IN SEEKING FOR HIDING PLACES THAN IN ATTACKING ENEMIES WHO OUTNUMBERED THEM IN THE PROPORTION OF A HUNDRED TO ONE 
Kannada-0041-4037	BUT AT THAT TIME NO STORY OF POPISH ATROCITY COULD BE SO WILD AND MARVELLOUS AS NOT TO FIND READY BELIEF THE MEETING SEPARATED IN DISMAY 
Kannada-0041-4038	THE WHOLE CITY WAS IN CONFUSION AT THIS MOMENT DANBY AT THE HEAD OF ABOUT A HUNDRED
Kannada-0041-4039	HORSEMEN RODE UP TO THE MILITIA AND RAISED THE CRY NO POPERY A FREE PARLIAMENT THE PROTESTANT RELIGION 
Kannada-0041-4040	THE MILITIA ECHOED THE SHOUT THE GARRISON WAS INSTANTLY SURPRISED AND DISARMED THE GOVERNOR WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST 
Kannada-0041-4041	THE GATES WERE CLOSED SENTINELS WERE POSTED EVERYWHERE THE POPULACE WAS SUFFERED TO PULL DOWN A ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL
Kannada-0041-4042	BUT NO OTHER HARM APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF THE SHIRE AND WITH THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATES OF THE CITY
Kannada-0041-4043	THE LORD MAYOR WAS PLACED IN THE CHAIR DANBY PROPOSED A DECLARATION SETTING FORTH THE REASONS WHICH HAD INDUCED THE FRIENDS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION TO RISE IN ARMS 
Kannada-0041-4044	THIS DECLARATION WAS EAGERLY ADOPTED AND RECEIVED IN A FEW HOURS THE SIGNATURES OF SIX PEERS OF FIVE BARONETS OF SIX KNIGHTS AND OF MANY GENTLEMEN OF HIGH CONSIDERATION
Kannada-0042-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE

Kannada-0042-0003	THE COMPANY WHICH RUNS RETAIL AUTOMOTIVE STORES TOLD SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISER TO TERMINATE DISCUSSIONS TO SELL THE FIRM 
Kannada-0042-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0042-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0042-4045	EVERY REGIONAL PARTY KNOWS THAT THIS SHIFT WILL GET INSTITUTIONALISED IF THE CURRENT REGIME REMAINS IN POWER
Kannada-0042-4046	IN THIS SCENARIO THE QUESTION OF WHO WOULD BE THE OPPOSITIONS PRIME MINISTERIAL FACE HAS GIVEN THE CONGRESS AN IDEAL OPENING
Kannada-0042-4047	TO PRESENT ITSELF AS THE ONLY PLATFORM WHERE REGIONAL AND NONSAVARNA AGENDAS CAN BE CREDIBLY ARTICULATED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL 
Kannada-0042-4048	IN FACT IF MR GANDHI WERE TO PROACTIVELY WITHDRAW FROM THE PRIME MINISTERIAL RACE IT COULD HELP IN THREE WAYS 
Kannada-0042-4049	FIRST IT WOULD PROVE WRONG MR MODIS CONTENTION THAT MR GANDHI IS IN A TEARING HURRY TO OCCUPY THE PRIME MINISTERS CHAIR 
Kannada-0042-4050	APART FROM BLUNTING THE USUAL BARBS ABOUT DYNASTIC POLITICS
Kannada-0042-4051	IT WOULD LEND CREDIBILITY TO MR GANDHIS IMAGE OF A RELUCTANT POLITICIAN WHOSE DECISION TO ENTER THE ELECTORAL FRAY IS ROOTED NOT IN A LUST FOR POWER BUT IN IDEALISM
Kannada-0042-4052	SECOND IT WOULD CREATE A WELCOMING SPACE IN THE ALLIANCE FOR PARTIES THAT DISLIKE THE BJP
Kannada-0042-4053	BUT WOULD RATHER GO IT ALONE THAN PLAY SECOND FIDDLE IN SOMEONE ELSES PREPOLL ORCHESTRA
Kannada-0042-4054	THIRD FROM A LONGTERM PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THE ONLY VIABLE STRATEGY FOR A CONGRESS REVIVAL AT A TIME WHEN ITS GETTING SQUEEZED OUT IN STATE AFTER STATE 
Kannada-0042-4055	IN A WAY THIS ENTAILS A RETURN TO THE TEMPLATE OF THE OLD CONGRESS SYSTEM IN WHICH CONFLICTING INTERESTS WERE ACCOMMODATED UNDER A CAPACIOUS PLURALISTIC UMBRELLA 
Kannada-0042-4056	BUT UNLIKE IN THE PAST THIS TIME AROUND THE CONGRESS SYSTEM WOULD NEED TO BREAK FREE OF THE SAVARNA ELITE THAT STILL CONTROLS THE PARTY 
Kannada-0042-4057	IT NEEDS TO MOULD ITSELF INTO A NATIONAL PIVOT FOR NONSAVARNA AND REGIONAL INTERESTS THAT NOW FEEL COMPELLED TO ALLY WITH WHICHEVER PARTY IS IN POWER AT THE CENTRE
Kannada-0042-4058	REGARDLESS OF HOW REPUGNANT THEY MAY FIND ITS POLITICS IF THEY WISH TO SECURE EVEN THEIR BASIC ENTITLEMENTS 
Kannada-0042-4059	SOME LIKE THE TDP WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THIS DOESNT WORK ARE SURE TO BE INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVES
Kannada-0042-4060	MR GANDHI WHO HAS SHOWN SYMPATHY FOR BOTH SOCIAL JUSTICE AND FEDERALISM WOULD DO WELL TO DEVELOP THIS REALIGNMENT INTO SOMETHING MORE
Kannada-0042-4061	WE SAW ITS POTENTIAL IN KARNATAKA WHERE THE CONGRESS DESPITE WINNING MORE THAN DOUBLE
Kannada-0042-4062	THE NUMBER OF ASSEMBLY SEATS THE JANATA DAL DID GAVE THE CHIEF MINISTERSHIP TO THE REGIONAL PLAYER
Kannada-0042-4063	THE ONUS IS ON MR GANDHI TO REFINE THIS KARNATAKA MODEL AS IT WERE FOR THE NATIONAL STAGE
Kannada-0042-4064	THIS MODEL OF POLITICS REQUIRES THE CONGRESS TO CONCEDE MORE SPACE TO SMALLER PARTIES AND TAKE A LONGTERM VIEW OF ALLIANCES 
Kannada-0042-4065	IN CONTRAST THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT GUJARAT MODEL IS A RUTHLESSLY HOMOGENISING FORCE WHERE ONE PARTY CALLS THE SHOTS
Kannada-0042-4066	THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ELECTIONS MAY THUS SEE A CONTEST BETWEEN THE GUJARAT MODEL AND THE KARNATAKA MODEL 
Kannada-0042-4067	IT IS UP TO THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AND THE CONGRESS IN PARTICULAR TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT A ONESIDED ONE
Kannada-0042-4068	SURAJPRASAD NAIPAUL WHO PASSED AWAY AT HIS LONDON HOME ON AUGUST ELEVENTH JUST SIX DAYS SHORT OF HIS EIGHTY SIXTH BIRTHDAY 
Kannada-0042-4069	WILL CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE HIS READERS AND CRITICS AFTER DEATH AS HE DID IN A WRITING CAREER SPANNING MORE THAN FIVE DECADES 
Kannada-0042-4070	AT FIRST JAMES SEEMED DISPOSED TO MAKE EXCELLENT USE OF THE TIME WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FOR CONSIDERATION 
Kannada-0042-4071	THE CHANCELLOR WAS DIRECTED TO ISSUE WRITS CONVOKING A PARLIAMENT FOR THE THIRTEENTH OF JANUARY 
Kannada-0042-4072	HALIFAX WAS SENT FOR TO THE CLOSET HAD A LONG AUDIENCE AND SPOKE WITH MUCH MORE FREEDOM THAN HE HAD THOUGHT IT DECOROUS TO USE IN THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE ASSEMBLY 
Kannada-0042-4073	HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED A COMMISSIONER TO TREAT WITH THE PRINCE OF ORANGE 
Kannada-0042-4074	WITH HIM WERE JOINED NOTTINGHAM AND GODOLPHIN THE KING DECLARED THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO MAKE GREAT SACRIFICES FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE 
Kannada-0042-4075	HALIFAX ANSWERED THAT GREAT SACRIFICES WOULD DOUBTLESS BE REQUIRED YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID
Kannada-0042-4076	MUST NOT EXPECT THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER IN THEIR HANDS WILL CONSENT TO ANY TERMS WHICH WOULD LEAVE THE LAWS AT THE MERCY OF THE PREROGATIVE
Kannada-0042-4077	WITH THIS DISTINCT EXPLANATION OF HIS VIEWS HE ACCEPTED THE COMMISSION WHICH THE KING WISHED HIM TO UNDERTAKE 
Kannada-0042-4078	THE CONCESSIONS WHICH A FEW HOURS BEFORE HAD BEEN SO OBSTINATELY REFUSED WERE NOW MADE IN THE MOST LIBERAL MANNER 
Kannada-0042-4079	A PROCLAMATION WAS PUT FORTH BY WHICH THE KING NOT ONLY GRANTED A FREE PARDON TO ALL WHO WERE IN REBELLION AGAINST HIM 
Kannada-0042-4080	BUT DECLARED THEM ELIGIBLE TO BE MEMBERS OF THE APPROACHING PARLIAMENT 
Kannada-0042-4081	IT WAS NOT EVEN REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY THAT THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS 
Kannada-0042-4082	THE SAME GAZETTE WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT THE HOUSES WERE ABOUT TO MEET CONTAINED A NOTIFICATION THAT SIR EDWARD HALES WHO AS A PAPIST AS A RENEGADE 
Kannada-0042-4083	AS THE FOREMOST CHAMPION OF THE DISPENSING POWER AND AS THE HARSH GAOLER OF THE BISHOPS WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR MEN IN THE REALM HAD CEASED TO BE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER
Kannada-0042-4084	AND HAD BEEN SUCCEEDED BY HIS LATE PRISONER BEVIL SKELTON WHO THOUGH HE HELD NO HIGH PLACE IN THE ESTEEM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WAS AT LEAST NOT DISQUALIFIED BY LAW FOR PUBLIC TRUST

Kannada-0048-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0048-4288	THIS IS WHY THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT WAS CELEBRATED LAST YEAR 
Kannada-0048-4289	IT SIGNIFIED HOPE THAT THINGS COULD GET BETTER THAT VALUES OF FREEDOM AUTONOMY AND DIGNITY WOULD BE REALISED 
Kannada-0048-4290	HOWEVER THE SRIKRISHNA REPORT SHOWS THAT THE DANGER TO A HIGH CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE MAY MORE OFTEN BE THAT IT IS DISREGARDED RATHER THAN THAT IT IS DISOBEYED 
Kannada-0048-4291	BY REFRAMING AND REINTERPRETING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY THE REPORT ENTRENCHES THE POSITIONS OF THE TWO ENTITIES
Kannada-0048-4292	WHICH ALREADY WIELD THE MOST POWER OVER ORDINARY INDIANS CORPORATIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT 
Kannada-0048-4293	AS TIME PASSES WE WILL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK BACK TO THE DAY WHEN THE SUPREME COURT DECLARED THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY 
Kannada-0048-4294	WHEN WE DO WE SHOULD FEEL RELIEF RATHER THAN REGRET
Kannada-0048-4295	GIVEN THE VAST AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL DATA BEING COLLECTED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES AND STATE AGENCIES AND THEIR FLOW ACROSS NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS
Kannada-0048-4296	THE ABSENCE OF A DATA PROTECTION LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN INDIA HAS BEEN A CAUSE FOR DEEP CONCERN
Kannada-0048-4297	THIS IS EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE IN MANY CASES INDIVIDUALS WHOSE DATA HAVE BEEN USED AND PROCESSED BY AGENCIES
Kannada-0048-4298	BOTH PRIVATE FIRMS AND STATE ENTITIES ARE OBLIVIOUS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY ARE BEING HARNESSED 
Kannada-0048-4299	THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION WAS ALSO UNDERLINED LAST YEAR WITH THE LANDMARK JUDGMENT IN JUSTICE PUTTASWAMY VERSUS UNION OF INDIA THAT HELD THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT
Kannada-0048-4300	AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THE DRAFT LEGISLATION ON DATA PROTECTION SUBMITTED BY A COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS CHAIRED BY JUSTICE SRIKRISHNA TO THE MINISTRY
Kannada-0048-4301	AFTER YEARLONG PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS PROVIDES A SOUND FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO SPEEDILY BUILD INDIAS LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
Kannada-0048-4302	THIS IS AKIN TO A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP THAT PLACES OBLIGATIONS ON THE ENTITIES ENTRUSTED WITH DATA
Kannada-0048-4303	AND WHO ARE OBLIGATED TO SEEK THE CONSENT OF THE PRINCIPAL FOR THE USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Kannada-0048-4304	THE DRAFT LEGISLATION PUTS THE ONUS ON THE DATA FIDUCIARY TO SEEK CLEAR INFORMED SPECIFIC AND FREE CONSENT 
Kannada-0048-4305	WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHDRAWAL OF DATA OF THE PRINCIPAL TO ALLOW FOR THE USE AND PROCESSING OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA
Kannada-0048-4306	IN MANY WAYS THE DRAFT LEGISLATION MIRRORS THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THE FRAMEWORK ON DATA PROTECTION IMPLEMENTED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION THIS MAY
Kannada-0048-4307	IT ENVISAGES THE CREATION OF A REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY OF INDIA TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF PRINCIPALS 
Kannada-0048-4308	AND TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENABLING DATA PROTECTION LEGISLATION 
Kannada-0048-4309	TAKEN TOGETHER THE DRAFT BILL AND THE REPORT MARK A WELCOME STEP FORWARD BUT THERE ARE SOME GREY AREAS 
Kannada-0048-4310	THE EXEMPTIONS GRANTED TO STATE INSTITUTIONS FROM ACQUIRING INFORMED CONSENT FROM PRINCIPALS OR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA IN MANY CASES APPEAR TO BE TOO BLANKET
Kannada-0048-4311	SUCH AS THOSE PERTAINING TO THE SECURITY OF THE STATE 
Kannada-0048-4312	THESE ARE HOLDALL PHRASES AND CHECKS ARE VITAL 
Kannada-0048-4313	THAT AFTERNOON THE TIDINGS OF THE FLIGHT REACHED LONDON THE KINGS ADHERENTS WERE CONFOUNDED THE WHIGS COULD NOT CONCEAL THEIR JOY 
Kannada-0048-4314	THE GOOD NEWS ENCOURAGED THE PRINCE TO TAKE A BOLD AND IMPORTANT STEP 
Kannada-0048-4315	HE WAS INFORMED THAT COMMUNICATIONS WERE PASSING BETWEEN THE FRENCH EMBASSY AND THE PARTY HOSTILE TO HIM 
Kannada-0048-4316	IT WAS WELL KNOWN THAT AT THAT EMBASSY ALL THE ARTS OF CORRUPTION WERE WELL UNDERSTOOD AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT 
Kannada-0048-4317	AT SUCH A CONJUNCTURE NEITHER INTRIGUES NOR PISTOLES WOULD BE SPARED 
Kannada-0048-4318	BARILLON WAS MOST DESIROUS TO REMAIN A FEW DAYS LONGER IN LONDON AND FOR THAT END OMITTED NO ART WHICH COULD CONCILIATE THE VICTORIOUS PARTY 
Kannada-0048-4319	IN THE STREETS HE QUIETED THE POPULACE WHO LOOKED ANGRILY AT HIS COACH BY THROWING MONEY AMONG THEM 
Kannada-0048-4320	AT HIS TABLE HE PUBLICLY DRANK THE HEALTH OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE BUT WILLIAM WAS NOT TO BE SO CAJOLED 
Kannada-0048-4321	HE HAD NOT INDEED TAKEN ON HIMSELF TO EXERCISE REGAL AUTHORITY BUT HE WAS A GENERAL AND AS SUCH HE WAS NOT BOUND TO TOLERATE 
Kannada-0048-4322	WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN MILITARY OCCUPATION THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHOM HE REGARDED AS A SPY 
Kannada-0048-4323	BEFORE THAT DAY CLOSED BARILLON WAS INFORMED THAT HE MUST LEAVE ENGLAND WITHIN TWENTYFOUR HOURS HE BEGGED HARD FOR A SHORT DELAY 
Kannada-0048-4324	BUT MINUTES WERE PRECIOUS THE ORDER WAS REPEATED IN MORE PEREMPTORY TERMS AND HE UNWILLINGLY SET OFF FOR DOVER 
Kannada-0048-4325	THAT NO MARK OF CONTEMPT AND DEFIANCE MIGHT BE OMITTED HE WAS ESCORTED TO THE COAST BY ONE OF HIS PROTESTANT COUNTRYMEN WHOM PERSECUTION HAD DRIVEN INTO EXILE 
Kannada-0048-4326	SO BITTER WAS THE RESENTMENT EXCITED BY THE FRENCH AMBITION AND ARROGANCE THAT EVEN THOSE ENGLISHMEN WHO WERE NOT GENERALLY DISPOSED TO TAKE A FAVOURABLE VIEW OF WILLIAMS CONDUCT

Kannada-0049-4329	WITHOUT SUCH AN ENABLING LAW THE EXEMPTIONS PROVIDED IN THE BILL WILL FALL SHORT OF SECURING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE STATE FOR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DRAGNET SURVEILLANCE 
Kannada-0049-4330	THE GREY AREAS MUST SPARK PUBLIC AND PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE BEFORE A FINAL LEGISLATION COMES TO FRUITION
Kannada-0049-4331	THE OUTCOME HAD BEEN ENSURED LONG BEFORE CAMBODIA WENT TO THE POLLS ON SUNDAY
Kannada-0049-4332	WITH PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN ENSURING HIS RETURN BY KEEPING KEY OPPOSITION LEADERS OUT OF THE FRAY AND MUZZLING THE MEDIA 
Kannada-0049-4333	THE NEXT MORNING A SPOKESPERSON FOR HIS CAMBODIAN PEOPLES PARTY WAS SMUGLY CLAIMING IT HAD WON ALL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PARLIAMENTARY SEATS RENEWING ITS MANDATE FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS 
Kannada-0049-4334	DESPITE OFFICIAL ESTIMATES OF TURNOUT IN EXCESS OF EIGHTY PERCENT THE CPPS VICTORY IS HOLLOW 
Kannada-0049-4335	MR HUN SEN WHO HAS BEEN AT THE HELM SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LEFT NOTHING TO CHANCE TO SEE THAT HIS PARTY WAS EFFECTIVELY UNCONTESTED 
Kannada-0049-4336	VOTERS WERE THREATENED WITH PUNISHMENT IF THEY RESPONDED TO CALLS FOR AN ELECTION BOYCOTT 
Kannada-0049-4337	A NUMBER OF DUMMY PARTIES JOINED WHAT INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CALLED A SHAM ELECTION
Kannada-0049-4338	SINCE CAMBODIAS FIRST FREE ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE CPPS SINGLEPARTY DOMINANCE HAD BEEN LARGELY ENABLED BY A FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION 
Kannada-0049-4339	BUT THINGS CHANGED BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ELECTIONS WITH THE MERGER OF TWO BIG OPPOSITION PARTIES TO FORM THE CAMBODIA NATIONAL RESCUE PARTY 
Kannada-0049-4340	THE CNRP CAME WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE RULING PARTY IN THOSE POLLS AND ITS IMPRESSIVE SHOWING IN THE JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN POLLS TO LOCAL BODIES UNDERSCORED ITS POTENTIAL FURTHER 
Kannada-0049-4341	WITHIN MONTHS THE COURTS ORDERED ITS DISSOLUTION ON ALLEGATIONS OF A PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE REGIME

Kannada-0049-4350	MR HUN SEN CONTINUES TO CAPITALISE ON HIS CLOSE TIES WITH BEIJING TO COUNTER DOMESTIC AND OVERSEAS CRITICISM OF HIS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
Kannada-0049-4351	THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LAST WEEK APPROVED LEGISLATION TO SANCTION TOP CAMBODIAN OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN THE VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW 
Kannada-0049-4352	THE MEASURE WILL BE TAKEN UP BY THE SENATE SOON 
Kannada-0049-4353	ON MONDAY THE LORDS MET AGAIN HALIFAX WAS CHOSEN TO PRESIDE 
Kannada-0049-4354	THE PRIMATE WAS ABSENT THE ROYALISTS SAD AND GLOOMY THE WHIGS EAGER AND IN HIGH SPIRITS IT WAS KNOWN THAT JAMES HAD LEFT A LETTER BEHIND HIM 
Kannada-0049-4355	SOME OF HIS FRIENDS MOVED THAT IT MIGHT BE PRODUCED IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN PROPOSITIONS WHICH MIGHT FURNISH A BASIS FOR A HAPPY SETTLEMENT 
Kannada-0049-4356	ON THIS MOTION THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WAS PUT AND CARRIED GOLD WHO WAS KNOWN NOT TO BE UNFRIENDLY TO HIS OLD MASTER UTTERED A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE DECISIVE 
Kannada-0049-4357	I HAVE SEEN THE PAPER HE SAID AND I GRIEVE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN IT WHICH WILL GIVE YOUR LORDSHIPS ANY SATISFACTION 
Kannada-0049-4358	IN TRUTH IT CONTAINED NO EXPRESSION OF REGRET FOR PASS ERRORS IT HELD OUT NO HOPE THAT THOSE ERRORS WOULD FOR THE FUTURE BE AVOIDED
Kannada-0049-4359	AND IT THREW THE BLAME OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED ON THE MALICE OF WILLIAM AND ON THE BLINDNESS OF A NATION DELUDED BY THE SPECIOUS NAMES OF RELIGION AND PROPERTY

Kannada-0050-4373	FARMERS HAVE ALREADY PASSED A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT 
Kannada-0050-4374	FAR FROM HELPING THE FARMERS THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY HARMED THEM IN THEIR HOUR OF CRISIS 
Kannada-0050-4375	THIS IS A STRONG INDICTMENT BACKED BY SOLID EVIDENCE
Kannada-0050-4376	HERE IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVE TO GIVE DATA ON SLUGGISH AGRICULTURAL GROWTH DURING THIS REGIME
Kannada-0050-4377	AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SUFFERED DUE TO CONSECUTIVE DROUGHTS FOR WHICH IT IS UNFAIR TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT 
Kannada-0050-4378	NOR CAN WE USE THE DATA ON FARMER SUICIDES TO MAKE A CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AS THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TINKERED SO MUCH
Kannada-0050-4379	BOTH WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM AND DATA COLLECTION ON IT THAT THE DATA HAS BEEN MADE UNUSABLE 
Kannada-0050-4380	FURTHER IN ANY CASE THE DATA ON FARMER SUICIDES HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS NOW
Kannada-0050-4381	HERE ARE TEN CONCRETE EVIDENCEBASED ARGUMENTS ON WHY THE FARMERS OF INDIA EXPRESS THEIR VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT
Kannada-0050-4382	FIRST THIS GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO ACT ON ANY OF ITS MAJOR ELECTION PROMISES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN 
Kannada-0050-4383	THE BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY BJPS MANIFESTO PROMISED NOTHING SHORT OF HIGHEST PRIORITY TO AGRICULTURAL GROWTH INCREASE IN FARMERS INCOME AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
Kannada-0050-4384	THE GOVERNMENTS OWN ECONOMIC SURVEY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS ALREADY CONCEDED THAT FARMERS REAL INCOME HAS REMAINED STAGNANT RECORDING A ONE POINT NINE PERCENT GROWTH OVER FOUR YEARS 
Kannada-0050-4385	THE CONCRETE PROMISE OF HIGHER PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE DID NOT MATERIALISE IN FACT IT HAS DECLINED IN TERMS OF ITS SHARE OF GDP
Kannada-0050-4386	THE NEW FARM INSURANCE SCHEME THE PRADHAN MANTRI FASAL BIMA YOJANA HAS CONSUMED THRICE AS MUCH MONEY AS EARLIER SCHEMES
Kannada-0050-4387	WITHOUT EITHER INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF FARMERS WHO BENEFITED FROM IT OR GIVING A FAIR CLAIM TO THE FARMERS 
Kannada-0050-4388	THE PROMISE OF WELFARE MEASURES FOR FARMERS ABOVE 60 SMALL FARMERS AND FARM LABOURERS WAS FORGOTTEN THE NATIONAL LAND USE POLICY WAS NEVER ENACTED 
Kannada-0050-4389	THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE MARKET COMMITTEE APMC ACT WAS NOT REFORMED WE DONT EVEN HAVE A PROMISES VS DELIVERY REPORT CARD YET
Kannada-0050-4390	SECOND THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY RENEGED ON ITS BIGGEST PROMISE OF ENSURING FIFTY PERCENT PROFIT OVER THE COST OF PRODUCTION TO THE FARMERS 
Kannada-0050-4391	IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT FILED AN AFFIDAVIT IN THE SUPREME COURT REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROMISE ON THE GROUND THAT IT WILL DISTORT THE AGRICULTURAL MARKET 
Kannada-0050-4392	AS PRESSURE FROM FARMER ORGANISATIONS MOUNTED THE GOVERNMENT SHIFTED THE GOALPOST IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET
Kannada-0050-4393	HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO LIGHT TASK THE WHOLE MACHINE OF GOVERNMENT WAS DISORDERED 
Kannada-0050-4394	THE JUSTICES OF THE PEACE HAD ABANDONED THEIR FUNCTIONS THE OFFICERS OF THE REVENUE HAD CEASED TO COLLECT THE TAXES 
Kannada-0050-4395	THE ARMY WHICH MARK HAD DISBANDED WAS STILL IN CONFUSION AND READY TO BREAK OUT INTO MUTINY 
Kannada-0050-4396	THE FLEET WAS IN A SCARCELY LESS ALARMING STATE LARGE ARREARS OF PAY WERE DUE TO THE CIVIL AND MILITARY SERVANTS OF THE CROWN AND ONLY FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS REMAINED IN THE EXCHEQUER
Kannada-0050-4397	THE PRINCE ADDRESSED HIMSELF WITH VIGOUR TO THE WORK OF RESTORING ORDER 
Kannada-0050-4398	HE PUBLISHED A PROCLAMATION BY WHICH ALL MAGISTRATES WERE CONTINUED IN OFFICE AND ANOTHER CONTAINING ORDERS FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE REVENUE
Kannada-0050-4399	THE NEW MODELLING OF THE ARMY WENT RAPIDLY ON MANY OF THE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN WHOM JAMES HAD REMOVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH REGIMENTS WERE REAPPOINTED 
Kannada-0050-4400	A WAY WAS FOUND OF EMPLOYING THE THOUSANDS OF IRISH SOLDIERS WHOM JAMES HAD BROUGHT INTO ENGLAND 
Kannada-0050-4401	THEY COULD NOT SAFELY BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY WERE OBJECTS OF RELIGIOUS AND NATIONAL ANIMOSITY THEY COULD NOT SAFELY BE SENT HOME TO REINFORCE THE ARMY OF TRYCONNEL 
Kannada-0050-4402	IT WAS THEREFORE DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SENT TO THE CONTINENT WHERE THEY MIGHT UNDER THE BANNERS OF THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA 
Kannada-0050-4403	RENDER INDIRECT BUT EFFECTUAL SERVICE TO THE CAUSE OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION AND OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION 
Kannada-0050-4404	DARTMOUTH WAS REMOVED FROM HIS COMMAND AND THE NAVY WAS CONCILIATED BY ASSURANCES THAT EVERY SAILOR SHOULD SPEEDILY RECEIVE HIS DUE 
Kannada-0050-4405	THE CITY OF LONDON UNDERTOOK TO EXTRICATE THE PRINCE FROM HIS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THE COMMON COUNCIL BY AN UNANIMOUS VOTE ENGAGED TO FIND HIM TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
Kannada-0050-4406	IT WAS THOUGHT A GREAT PROOF BOTH OF THE WEALTH AND OF THE PUBLIC SPIRIT OF THE MERCHANTS OF THE CAPITAL THAT IN FORTYEIGHT HOURS THE WHOLE SUM WAS RAISED ON NO SECURITY BUT THE PRINCES WORD 
Kannada-0050-4407	A FEW WEEKS BEFORE JAMES HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PROCURE A MUCH SMALLER SUM THOUGH HE HAD OFFERED TO PAY HIGHER INTEREST AND TO PLEDGE VALUABLE PROPERTY

Kannada-0053-4488	TO THOSE AGGRIEVED BY THE RIGOROUS RULES WHICH AIMED TO REVAMP CRICKET ADMINISTRATION IN THE COUNTRY 
Kannada-0053-4489	THE REASONING GIVEN IN THE ORDER OF A THREEJUDGE BENCH HEADED BY CHIEF JUSTICE DIPAK MISRA SUGGESTS THAT IT IS A PRAGMATIC MODIFICATION RATHER THAN A SIGNIFICANT CLIMBDOWN 
Kannada-0053-4490	JUSTICE LODHA A FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA HOWEVER FEELS THAT THE COURT HAS NOW KNOCKED OUT THE FOUNDATION OF HIS RECOMMENDATIONS 
Kannada-0053-4491	THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE CONCERNS THE COOLINGOFF PERIOD PRESCRIBED FOR OFFICEBEARERS BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO CONTEST FOR A SUBSEQUENT TERM 
Kannada-0053-4492	AGAINST THE PANELS VIEW THAT EVERY OFFICEBEARER OF THE BOARD OF CONTROL FOR CRICKET IN INDIA IN THE NATIONAL BOARD OR IN A STATE ASSOCIATION SHOULD HAVE A THREEYEAR BREAK AFTER A THREEYEAR TERM
Kannada-0053-4493	THE COURT HAS NOW ALLOWED TWO THREEYEAR TERMS THAT IS A TENURE OF SIX YEARS BEFORE THE MANDATORY BREAK KICKS IN 
Kannada-0053-4494	THE LOGIC BEHIND A COOLINGOFF PERIOD IS THAT OFFICEBEARERS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN LENGTHY TENURES THAT ENABLE THEM TO ESTABLISH PERSONAL FIEFDOMS 
Kannada-0053-4495	THE ARGUMENT AGAINST IT IS THAT THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE THAT AN OFFICEBEARER GAINS OVER THREE YEARS SHOULD NOT BE FRITTERED AWAY AND A SECOND TERM COULD HELP CONSOLIDATE SUCH LEARNINGS 
Kannada-0053-4496	THE BENCH HAS ACCEPTED THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS AND CHOSEN TO DEFER THE COOLINGOFF PERIOD UNTIL SHE COMPLETES TWO TERMS 
Kannada-0053-4497	GIVEN THAT THERE IS A NINEYEAR AGGREGATE LIMIT AS WELL AS AN AGE LIMIT OF SEVENTY FOR ANY OFFICEBEARER
Kannada-0053-4498	THIS CHANGE MAY NOT AMOUNT TO ANY SIGNIFICANT DILUTION OF THE CORE PRINCIPLE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PERPETUATION OF POWER CENTRES
Kannada-0053-4499	THE LODHA PANEL HAD ALSO FAVOURED THE ONE STATE ONE VOTE NORM 
Kannada-0053-4500	THIS MEANT THAT AN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING A STATE ALONE SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AS A VOTING MEMBER OF THE BCCI
Kannada-0053-4501	ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING A REGION WITHIN A STATE OR ENTITIES THAT DO NOT REPRESENT A TERRITORY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME VOTE OR STATUS 
Kannada-0053-4502	THIS NORM HAS BEEN OVERRULED 
Kannada-0053-4503	GUJARAT AND MAHARASHTRA WILL HAVE THREE VOTES EACH AS THE ASSOCIATIONS OF BARODA AND SAURASHTRA IN GUJARAT AND MUMBAI AND VIDARBHA IN MAHARASHTRA WILL HAVE SEPARATE VOTES 
Kannada-0053-4504	IN THIS TOO THE COURT HAS ACCEPTED THE REASONING THAT ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO INDIAN CRICKET NEED NOT BE STRIPPED OF THEIR FULL MEMBERSHIP 
Kannada-0053-4505	IT IS NOW UP TO THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE FUTURE TO DISPEL JUSTICE LODHAS APPREHENSIONS THAT THIS MAY LEAD TO MANIPULATION OF VOTES 
Kannada-0053-4506	WHETHER THE CHANGES ADOPTED BY THE COURT WHILE FINALISING A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE BCCI DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS FROM WHAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE LODHA COMMITTEE WILL BE A MATTER OF DEBATE 
Kannada-0053-4507	HOWEVER JUDICIAL INTERVENTION HAS BEEN IMMENSELY HELPFUL IN MAKING CRICKET ADMINISTRATION MORE EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL AND ADDRESSING THE CREDIBILITY DEFICIT OF RECENT TIMES

Kannada-0053-4513	AS SOON AS THE NEWS THAT THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WAS ON THE FRENCH COAST HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO VERSAILLES A PALACE WAS PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION
Kannada-0053-4514	CARRIAGES AND TROOPS OF GUARDS WERE DESPATCHED TO AWAIT HER ORDERSWORKMEN WERE EMPLOYED TO MEND THE CALAIS ROAD THAT HER JOURNEY MIGHT BE EASY 
Kannada-0053-4515	LARRY WAS NOT ONLY ASSURED THAT HIS PAST OFFENCES WERE FORGIVEN FOR HER SAKE

Kannada-0053-4518	PERSONS OF HIGH RANK WERE INSTANTLY DESPATCHED FROM VERMONT TO GREET AND ESCORT HIM
Kannada-0053-4519	MEANWHILE LEWIS ATTENDED BY HIS FAMILY AND HIS NOBILITY WENT FORTH IN STATE TO RECEIVE THE EXILED QUEEN 
Kannada-0053-4520	BEFORE HIS GORGEOUS COACH WENT THE SWISS HALBERDIERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT AND BEHIND IT RODE THE BODY GUARDS WITH CYMBALS CLASHING AND TRUMPETS PEALING 
Kannada-0053-4521	AFTER THE KING IN A HUNDRED CARRIAGES EACH DRAWN BY SIX HORSES CAME THE MOST SPLENDID ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE ALL FEATHERS RIBANDS JEWELS AND EMBROIDERY 
Kannada-0053-4522	BEFORE THE PROCESSION HAD GONE FAR IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT MARY WAS APPROACHING 
Kannada-0053-4523	LEWIS ALIGHTED AND ADVANCED ON FOOT TO MEET HER SHE BROKE FORTH INTO PASSIONATE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE

Kannada-0054-4529	LAST WEEK MICHEL BARNIER THE EUROPEAN UNIONS CHIEF NEGOTIATOR SUGGESTED IN A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE A SOFTENING OF THE EUS POSITION ON THE IRISH BACKSTOP
Kannada-0054-4530	A TEMPORARY CUSTOMS ARRANGEMENT TO AVOID A HARD BORDER BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND UNTIL A PERMANENT SOLUTION IS FOUND 
Kannada-0054-4531	BOTH THE EU AND THE UK ARE AGAINST A HARD BORDER BETWEEN IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND KEY TO THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT THAT HAS ENSURED PEACE ON THE ISLAND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT 
Kannada-0054-4532	HOWEVER BEYOND OFFERING VAGUE LANGUAGE ON REGULATORY ALIGNMENT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW BRITAIN PROPOSES TO ACHIEVE THIS WHILE EXITING THE EU CUSTOMS UNION AND SINGLE MARKET 
Kannada-0054-4533	THE EU HAD PROPOSED THAT NORTHERN IRELAND REMAIN IN A COMMON REGULATORY AREA WITH THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND THE EU THIS WAS REJECTED BY LONDON 
Kannada-0054-4534	MR BARNIER WROTE THAT THE EU WOULD BE WILLING TO IMPROVE THE TEXT OF ITS PROPOSAL ON THE IRISH BORDER QUESTION
Kannada-0054-4535	HOWEVER HIS ARTICLE POURED COLD WATER ON ANOTHER CORE ELEMENT OF THE CHEQUERS PLAN
Kannada-0054-4536	A POSTBREXIT FREE TRADE AREA BETWEEN BRITAIN AND THE EU FOR GOODS ALONE LEAVING TRADE IN SERVICES FOR A SEPARATE AGREEMENT 
Kannada-0054-4537	THE UK AND THE EU WOULD COLLECT TARIFFS ON GOODS ON EACH OTHERS BEHALF WHERE NEEDED 
Kannada-0054-4538	MR BARNIER POINTED OUT THAT GOODS AND SERVICES ARE OFTEN INEXTRICABLY LINKED AND THAT THE UK CANNOT EXPECT TO HAVE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS WITHOUT FREE MOVEMENT OF SERVICES
Kannada-0054-4539	THE TIMING OF MR BARNIERS COMMENTS JUST AS MS MAY WAS TRYING TO WIN SUPPORT ON THE CONTINENT WILL THROW A SPANNER IN THE WORKS FOR HER 
Kannada-0054-4540	MR MACRON IS ONE OF MS MAYS TOUGHEST BREXIT CUSTOMERS AND IS UNLIKELY TO PRESENT A DIVERGENT VIEW FROM BRUSSELS 
Kannada-0054-4541	FRANCE HAS A LOT TO GAIN FROM PARTS OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR LEAVING THE UK AFTER BREXIT 
Kannada-0054-4542	A BREXIT DEAL MUST IDEALLY BE IN PLACE BEFORE A EUROPEAN SUMMIT IN OCTOBER OTHERWISE BRITAIN IS AT RISK OF CRASHING OUT OF THE EU IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN
Kannada-0054-4543	INDIAS LAW GOVERNING MOTOR VEHICLES AND TRANSPORT IS ARCHAIC LACKING THE PROVISIONS NECESSARY TO MANAGE FAST MOTORISATION 
Kannada-0054-4544	THE LACUNAE IN THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT REQUIRE TO BE ADDRESSED TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY ENSURE ORDERLY USE OF VEHICLES AND EXPAND PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
Kannada-0054-4545	THE MOTOR VEHICLES AMENDMENT BILL PASSED BY THE LOK SABHA LAST YEAR SEEKS TO DO THIS
Kannada-0054-4546	IT HAS NOW RUN INTO OPPOSITION IN THE RAJYA SABHA BECAUSE OF ITS PERCEIVED SHIFT OF POWER FROM THE STATES TO THE CENTRE 
Kannada-0054-4547	THE ISSUE IS NOT ONE OF LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCE AS THE SUBJECT IS IN THE CONCURRENT LIST PARLIAMENT CAN MAKE A LAW DEFINING POWERS AVAILABLE TO THE STATES 
Kannada-0054-4548	SOME STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW PROVISIONS SECTIONS SIXTY SIX AND EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WILL EMPOWER THE CENTRE TO FORM A NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION POLICY THROUGH A PROCESS OF CONSULTATION
Kannada-0054-4549	THE CHANGES WILL ALSO ENABLE CENTRALLYDRAFTED SCHEMES TO BE ISSUED FOR NATIONAL MULTIMODAL AND INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PASSENGERS
Kannada-0054-4550	SINCE ALL THIS REPRESENTS A NEW PARADIGM THAT WOULD SHAKE UP THE SECTOR SEVERAL STATES HAVE OPPOSED THE PROVISIONS AS BEING ANTIFEDERAL 
Kannada-0054-4551	DOING NOTHING HOWEVER IS NO LONGER AN OPTION 
Kannada-0054-4552	THE PASSENGER TRANSPORT SECTOR OPERATING WITHIN CITIES AND PROVIDING INTERCITY SERVICES HAS GROWN AMORPHOUSLY
Kannada-0054-4553	IN THE UNITED PROVINCES THE EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY THE TIDINGS FROM ENGLAND WAS EVEN GREATER THAN IN FRANCE 
Kannada-0054-4554	THIS WAS THE MOMENT AT WHICH THE BATAVIAN FEDERATION REACHED THE HIGHEST POINT OF POWER AND GLORY 
Kannada-0054-4555	FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE 
Kannada-0054-4556	NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT 
Kannada-0054-4557	THE INHABITANTS OF THE HAGUE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING ALBERT 
Kannada-0054-4558	HIS HOUSE WAS SO CLOSELY BESET BY THE POPULACE DAY AND NIGHT THAT SCARCELY ANY PERSON VENTURED TO VISIT HIM AND HE WAS AFRAID THAT HIS CHAPEL WOULD BE BURNED TO THE GROUND 
Kannada-0054-4559	AS MAIL AFTER MAIL ARRIVED WITH NEWS OF THE PRINCES PROGRESS THE SPIRITS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER AND WHEN AT LENGTH IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE HAD 
Kannada-0054-4560	ON THE INVITATION OF THE LORDS AND OF AN ASSEMBLY OF EMINENT COMMONERS TAKEN ON HIMSELF THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION A GENERAL CRY OF PRIDE AND JOY ROSE FROM ALL THE DUTCH FACTIONS
Kannada-0054-4561	AN EXTRAORDINARY MISSION WAS WITH GREAT SPEED DESPATCHED TO CONGRATULATE HIM 
Kannada-0054-4562	DAVIS WHOSE ADROITNESS AND INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH POLITICS MADE HIS ASSISTANCE AT SUCH A CONJUNCTURE PECULIARLY VALUABLE WAS ONE OF THE AMBASSADORS 
Kannada-0054-4563	AND WITH HIM WAS JOINED NICHOLAS WITSEN A MASTER OF AMSTERDAM WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING TO ALL EUROPE

Kannada-0055-4570	AS THINGS STAND STATERUN SERVICES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE TIMES 
Kannada-0055-4571	MAJOR INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE URBAN METRO RAIL SYSTEMS ARE YIELDING POOR RESULTS IN THE ABSENCE OF LASTMILE CONNECTIVITY SERVICES
Kannada-0055-4572	CREATING AN EQUITABLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ORDERLY GROWTH OF SERVICES IS CRITICAL 
Kannada-0055-4573	THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CHANGES TO THE MV ACT THAT SET BENCHMARKS FOR STATES
Kannada-0055-4574	ENABLING WELLRUN BUS SERVICES TO OPERATE ACROSS STATES WITH SUITABLE PERMIT CHARGES IS AN IMPERATIVE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A GROWING ECONOMY 
Kannada-0055-4575	REGULATORY CHANGES INTRODUCED IN EUROPE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS FOR BUS SERVICES HAVE FOSTERED COMPETITION REDUCED FARES AND INCREASED SERVICES OPERATING ACROSS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSTATES 
Kannada-0055-4576	OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DEAL WITH ROAD SAFETY THESE HOWEVER ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE LITTLE WITHOUT STRONG ENFORCEMENT BY THE STATES 
Kannada-0055-4577	THE EFFORT TO CURB INSTITUTIONALISED CORRUPTION AT REGIONAL TRANSPORT OFFICES BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR DEALERS TO DIRECTLY REGISTER NEW VEHICLES
Kannada-0055-4578	CARE IS NEEDED TO SEE THAT OTHER MEASURES SUCH AS SHARPLY ENHANCING FINES FOR RULE VIOLATIONS DO NOT ONLY RESULT IN GREATER HARASSMENT 
Kannada-0055-4579	IT IS THE CERTAINTY OF ENFORCEMENT ZERO TOLERANCE AND ESCALATING PENALTIES THAT WILL REALLY WORK 
Kannada-0055-4580	THERE ARE SOME NEW PROVISIONS TO HARNESS TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING CCTV MONITORING TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY
Kannada-0055-4581	BUT THESE CANNOT PRODUCE RESULTS WHEN THERE IS NO PROFESSIONAL ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION AGENCY TO DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES
Kannada-0055-4582	INDIAN BANKS TRYING TO SELL THEIR TROUBLED ASSETS NOW HAVE ONE LESS HURDLE TO CROSS 
Kannada-0055-4583	A GROUP OF BANKS INCLUDING PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR AND FOREIGN BANKS SIGNED AN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ON MONDAY

Kannada-0055-4585	ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT A MAJORITY REPRESENTING TWOTHIRDS OF THE LOANS WITHIN A CONSORTIUM OF LENDERS SHOULD NOW BE SUFFICIENT
Kannada-0055-4586	TO OVERRIDE ANY OBJECTION TO THE RESOLUTION PROCESS COMING FROM DISSENTING LENDERS 
Kannada-0055-4587	MINORITY LENDERS WHO SUSPECT THEY ARE BEING SHORTCHANGED BY OTHER LENDERS CAN NOW EITHER SELL THEIR ASSETS AT A DISCOUNT TO A WILLING BUYER OR BUY OUT LOANS FROM OTHER LENDERS AT A PREMIUM 
Kannada-0055-4588	THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT IS AIMED AT THE RESOLUTION OF LOAN ACCOUNTS WITH A SIZE OF FIFTY CRORE AND ABOVE THAT ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF A GROUP OF LENDERS 
Kannada-0055-4589	IT IS PART OF THE SASHAKT PLAN APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF RESOLVING BAD LOANS 
Kannada-0055-4590	OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS INDIAN BANKS HAVE BEEN FORCED BY THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA TO RECOGNISE TROUBLED ASSETS ON THEIR BOOKS BUT THEIR RESOLUTION HAS REMAINED A CHALLENGE
Kannada-0055-4591	ACCORDING TO BANKER SUNIL MEHTA WHO HEADED A PANEL THAT RECOMMENDED THE PLAN DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN JOINT LENDERS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN RESOLVING STRESSED ASSETS 
Kannada-0055-4592	THE GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT THE HOLDOUT PROBLEM WHERE THE OBJECTIONS OF A FEW LENDERS PREVENT A SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE MAJORITY LENDERS WILL BE SOLVED THROUGH THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT
Kannada-0055-4593	THUS TWO SECTIONS OF THE TORY PARTY A SECTION WHICH LOOKED FORWARD TO AN ACCOMMODATION WITH JAMES 
Kannada-0055-4594	AND A SECTION WHICH WAS OPPOSED TO ANY SUCH ACCOMMODATION AGREED IN SUPPORTING THE PLAN OF REGENCY 
Kannada-0055-4595	BUT A THIRD SECTION WHICH THOUGH NOT VERY NUMEROUS HAD GREAT WEIGHT AND INFLUENCE RECOMMENDED A VERY DIFFERENT PLAN 
Kannada-0055-4596	THE LEADERS OF THIS SMALL BAND WERE DANBY AND THE BISHOP OF LONDON IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND SIR ROBERT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Kannada-0055-4597	THEY CONCEIVED THAT THEY HAD FOUND OUT A WAY OF EFFECTING A COMPLETE REVOLUTION UNDER STRICTLY LEGAL FORMS 
Kannada-0055-4598	IT WAS CONTRARY TO ALL PRINCIPLE THEY SAID THAT THE KING SHOULD BE DEPOSED BY HIS SUBJECTS NOR WAS IT NECESSARY TO DEPOSE HIM

Kannada-0055-4602	IT WAS DUE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY AND TO THE NATION THAT ALL DOUBTS SHOULD BE CLEARED UP 
Kannada-0055-4603	AN INVESTIGATION HAD BEEN SOLEMNLY DEMANDED IN THE NAME OF THE PRINCESS OF ORANGE BY HER HUSBAND AND WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED 
Kannada-0055-4604	IF THE PARTIES WHO WERE ACCUSED OF FRAUD HAD NOT TAKEN A COURSE WHICH IN ANY ORDINARY CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A DECISIVE PROOF OF GUILT 
Kannada-0055-4605	THEY HAD NOT CHOSEN TO AWAIT THE ISSUE OF A SOLEMN PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDING THEY HAD STOLEN AWAY INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY 
Kannada-0055-4606	THEY HAD CARRIED WITH THEM THE CHILD THEY HAD CARRIED WITH THEM ALL THOSE FRENCH AND ITALIAN WOMEN OF THE BEDCHAMBER WHO IF THERE HAD BEEN FOUL PLAY 
Kannada-0055-4607	MUST HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO IT AND WHO OUGHT THEREFORE TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO A RIGOROUS CROSS EXAMINATION

Tamil-0003-8153	THE FACT THAT THESE MPS MERGED WITH THE BJP AS A GROUP HELPED THEM STAY CLEAR OF THE ANTIDEFECTION LAW WHICH STIPULATES THAT A BREAKAWAY GROUP CONSTITUTE AT LEAST TWOTHIRDS OF A LEGISLATIVE PARTYS STRENGTH AND THAT IT MERGE WITH ANOTHER PARTY
Tamil-0003-8154	THE TDP HAD BEEN REDUCED TO JUST TWENTY THREE AND TWO SEATS IN THE NEWLY ELECTED ANDHRA PRADESH AND TELANGANA ASSEMBLIES RESPECTIVELY
Tamil-0003-8155	IT NOW COMMANDS A MUCH LOWER LEGISLATIVE PROFILE WITH JUST TWO MEMBERS IN THE RAJYA SABHA AND THREE IN THE LOK SABHA
Tamil-0003-8156	THERE IS A TENDENCY AMONG LEGISLATORS TO SEEK GREENER PASTURES AT A TIME OF CRISIS FOR THEIR PARTIES BUT THE NATURE OF THESE DEFECTIONS SUGGESTS THAT THIS WAS NOT A SIMPLE CASE OF LEAVING A PARTY WHOSE POLITICAL STRENGTH HAD CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED
Tamil-0003-8157	THE BJP IS EVEN MORE OF A NONPLAYER IN ANDHRA PRADESH AS IT DOES NOT HOLD A SINGLE SEAT IN THE CURRENT ASSEMBLY AND ITS VOTE SHARE DIPPED IN COMPARISON TO THE PREVIOUS ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS
Tamil-0003-8158	THE REASONS FOR THE DEFECTIONS APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THE POLITICAL EQUATIONS IN THE PARENT STATESOME OF THE DEFECTING LEGISLATORS HAVE A CLOUD OF SUSPICION OVER THEM AS THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO PROBES BY CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION ENFORCEMENT DIRECTORATE AND INCOME TAX OFFICIALS OVER FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
Tamil-0003-8159	IT WOULD BE IN ORDER TO ASK WHETHER THE DEFECTIONS ARE AIMED AT CURRYING FAVOUR WITH THE GOVERNMENT AT THE CENTRE IN REGARD TO THE INVESTIGATIONS
Tamil-0003-8160	THE NDA GOVERNMENT LED BY PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI HAS PROMISED ZERO TOLERANCE ON CORRUPTION AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST TWO OF THE DEFECTING MPS CONTINUE UNHINDERED
Tamil-0003-8161	AT THE SAME TIME THE FACT THAT THE BJP HAS CHOSEN TO ACCOMMODATE LEGISLATORS THE PARTY HAD ONLY MONTHS AGO CASTIGATED FOR BEING CORRUPT AND AGAINST WHOM ONE OF ITS OWN MPS HAD SOUGHT ACTION FROM THE RAJYA SABHA ETHICS COMMITTEE SUGGESTS THAT THE BENEFITS OF ACCRUAL TO ITS NUMBERS OUTWEIGHED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF PRINCIPLE
Tamil-0003-8162	THE BJP HAS MANAGED TO INCREASE ITS STRENGTH IN THE RAJYA SABHA TO SEVENTY FIVE WITH THE ADDITION OF THE DEFECTORS FROM THE TDP
Tamil-0003-8163	FRESH ELECTIONS TO THE RAJYA SABHA ARE DUE FOR A SUBSTANTIVE NUMBER OF SEATS BY TWENTY TWENTY AND DEFECTIONS SUCH AS THESE WILL HELP THE RULING COMBINE GET CLOSER TO THE MAJORITY MARK IN THE TWO FOURTY FIVEMEMBER UPPER HOUSE

Tamil-0010-8398	THE OTHER SEPARATE INVITATION TO PRIME MINISTER PRAVIND JUGNAUTH OF MAURITIUS WHO VISITED INDIA IN JANUARY THIS YEAR AS CHIEF GUEST AT THE PRAVASI BHARATIYA CONFERENCE IS AN AFFIRMATION OF THE CLOSE AFFINITY BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
Tamil-0010-8399	IT WOULD BE UNWISE HOWEVER TO READ MEANINGS INTO MRMODIS CHOICE OF INTERNATIONAL DIGNITARIES BEYOND THIS SYMBOLISM
Tamil-0010-8400	INDIAS ENGAGEMENT WITH BOTH BIMSTEC AND THE SCO WHICH INDIA JOINED AS AN OBSERVER IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IS AT A PROMISING BUT INCIPIENT STAGE
Tamil-0010-8401	AFTER ITS FORMATION IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BIMSTEC MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS AND DIDNT EVEN HAVE A FULLY WORKING SECRETARIAT UNTIL RECENTLY
Tamil-0010-8402	ITS DELIBERATIONS ON SUBREGIONAL CONNECTIVITY HAVE BEEN DELAYED OWING TO CONCERNS IN BHUTAN WHILE NEPAL AND THAILAND SENT ONLY OBSERVERS TO THE MILITARY EXERCISES LAST YEAR DUE TO OTHER MISGIVINGS
Tamil-0010-8403	EVEN SO INDIA SEES BIMSTEC AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO SAARC WHICH HAS FAILED TO MEET FOR FIVE YEARS
Tamil-0010-8404	THE SCO WHICH INDUCTED INDIA AND PAKISTAN AS FULL MEMBERS LAST YEAR IS YET TO DEMONSTRATE ITS UTILITY FOR INDIA BUT IS SEEN AS A POSSIBLE BALANCER AT A TIME WHEN THE USIS TAKING A MORE AGGRESSIVE POSITION ON TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN VENEZUELA AND RUSSIA ALL OF WHICH ARE SOURCES OF CONCERN FOR INDIA
Tamil-0010-8405	AS A RESULT THE ATTENDANCE AT MRMODIS SWEARINGIN CEREMONY ON THURSDAY AND THE BILATERAL MEETINGS THAT WILL FOLLOW ON FRIDAY MAY REPRESENT LITTLE BY WAY OF ACTUAL OUTCOMES
Tamil-0010-8406	RATHER IT IS A STATEMENT OF INTENT ON NEW AVENUES OF INDIAS MULTILATERAL ENGAGEMENTS
Tamil-0010-8407	PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODIS DECLARATION THAT THE TRUST OF ALL  SABKA VISHWAS  WILL BE A DIMENSION OF GOVERNANCE IN HIS SECOND TERM IS REASSURING COMING AS IT DOES AFTER THE HIGHLY DIVISIVE AND FACTFREE CAMPAIGN HE LED FOR THE SEVENTEEN TH GENERAL ELECTION
Tamil-0010-8408	IN A TWITTER POST AS THE RESULTS WERE BEING ANNOUNCED ON MAY TWENTY THREE MRMODI SPRUCED UP A MANTRA THAT HE HAS UTTERED FOR LONG  SABKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS TRANSLATED AS COLLECTIVE EFFORTS INCLUSIVE GROWTH ON HIS WEBSITE  WITH THIS THIRD TENET
Tamil-0010-8409	MRMODI LATER ELABORATED ON THE THEME AND SAID THE BJP NEEDED TO WIN THE TRUST PARTICULARLY OF THE MINORITIES
Tamil-0010-8410	THE VERY ADMISSION BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE NEED TO GAIN THE TRUST OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE ALLOWS HIGH HOPES FOR THOSE WHO AGONISE OVER THE PROSPECTS OF A MAJORITARIAN SLIDE IN INDIAN DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0010-8411	WHILE HE RIGHTLY IDENTIFIED THE TRUST DEFICIT THE BJP FACES AMONG RELIGIOUS AND LINGUISTIC MINORITIES AND STRESSED THE NEED TO OVERCOME IT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH INTROSPECTION LET ALONE REMORSE
Tamil-0010-8412	HE APPEARED TO OVERLOOK THE REASONS FOR THE MISTRUST IN THE BJP AND PUT THE BLAME ON HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS WHO HE ALLEGED HAD CREATED AN IMAGINARY FEAR AMONG THE MINORITIES
Tamil-0010-8413	THERE EXISTS AN EASY CHANNEL OF POLITICAL MOBILISATION WHERE THE FEAR ABOUT THE BJP AMONG MINORITIES IS AMPLIFIED BUT IT IS UNDENIABLY BASED ON ITS RHETORIC AND TRACK RECORD
Tamil-0010-8414	THE GUJARAT RIOTS OF TWO THOUSAND TWO WHEN MRMODI WAS CHIEF MINISTER REMAIN A HAUNTING MEMORY
Tamil-0010-8415	RECURRING INCIDENTS OF MOB VIOLENCE AGAINST THE MINORITIES BY BJP SUPPORTERS GO UNPUNISHED AS PARTY LEADERS INCLUDING MRMODI MAINTAIN A CONDONING SILENCE
Tamil-0010-8416	THEREFORE THE PRIME MINISTERS STATEMENT ABOUT WINNING THE TRUST OF THE MINORITIES AND ACCOMMODATING REGIONAL ASPIRATIONS WHILE PURSUING NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS MUST BE BACKED WITH ACTION
Tamil-0010-8417	MRMODI IS PROJECTED AS A MAN OF ACTION BUT POLITICS IS DRIVEN ALSO BY RHETORIC
Tamil-0010-8418	HE MUST SUSTAIN AND EMBELLISH HIS NEW SLOGAN WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC TENACITY WITHOUT SLACKENING ON THE QUESTION OF COMMUNAL HARMONY GOING BY EXPERIENCE
Tamil-0010-8419	IN TWENTY ELEVEN HE HELD A SERIES OF SADBHAVNA FASTS IN GUJARAT TO SPREAD THE MESSAGE THAT HE DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE MAJORITY AND THE MINORITY  BUT DID NOT FOLLOW UP TO DEEPEN THE MESSAGE
Tamil-0010-8420	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE WIDER SANGH PARIVAR WILL NOT TAKE KINDLY TO SUGGESTIONS OF PARITY BETWEEN HINDUS AND NONHINDUS AN AXIOMATIC CONSTITUTIONAL TRUTH
Tamil-0010-8421	GAUTAM GAMBHIR FORMER CRICKETER AND NOW BJP MP HAD TO CITE MRMODIS NEW CREED IN HIS DEFENCE AFTER BEING CORNERED ONLINE BY BJP SYMPATHISERS FOR RIGHTLY CONDEMNING A MOB ATTACK ON A MUSLIM IN GURUGRAM
Tamil-0010-8422	MRMODI HAS CONTINUOUSLY CLAIMED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS DECISIVE AND STRONG WHICH WILL BE MEANINGLESS IF IT FAILS IN THE FACE OF DIVISIVENESS
Tamil-0010-8423	A SLAVE ILLTREATED BY HIS MASTER RUNS AWAY TO THE FOREST 
Tamil-0010-8424	THERE HE COMES ACROSS A LION IN PAIN BECAUSE OF A THORN IN HIS PAW 
Tamil-0010-8425	THE SLAVE BRAVELY GOES FORWARD AND REMOVES THE THORN GENTLY
Tamil-0010-8426	THE LION WITHOUT HURTING HIM GOES AWAY
Tamil-0010-8427	SOME DAYS LATER THE SLAVES MASTER COMES HUNTING TO THE FOREST AND CATCHES MANY ANIMALS AND CAGES THEM 
Tamil-0010-8428	THE SLAVE IS SPOTTED BY THE MASTERS MEN WHO CATCH HIM AND BRING HIM TO THE CRUEL MASTER
Tamil-0010-8429	THE MASTER ASKS FOR THE SLAVE TO BE THROWN INTO THE LIONS CAGE
Tamil-0010-8430	THE SLAVE IS AWAITING HIS DEATH IN THE CAGE WHEN HE REALIZES THAT IT IS THE SAME LION THAT HE HAD HELPED 
Tamil-0010-8431	THE SLAVE RESCUED THE LION AND ALL OTHER CAGED ANIMALS

Tamil-0011-8434	THE POLITICS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ENTERED A CHAOTIC IF NOT ENTIRELY DARK PHASE
Tamil-0011-8435	PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY HAS ANNOUNCED IN THE WAKE OF HER INABILITY TO DELIVER AN ACCEPTABLE FORMULA FOR BREXIT THAT SHE WOULD STEP DOWN ON JUNE SEVEN 
Tamil-0011-8436	HER COLLEAGUES IN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY REMAIN DEEPLY DIVIDED OVER THE TERMS OF THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT SHE NEGOTIATED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND HAVE REJECTED THREE TIMES HER ATTEMPTS TO GET IT PASSED IN PARLIAMENT
Tamil-0011-8437	THAT AGREEMENT IS IN PRINCIPLE BASED ON THE NOTION OF THE UK
Tamil-0011-8438	LEAVING THE EUS SINGLE MARKET AND CUSTOMS UNION THE TERMINATION OF RESIDENCY AND WORK RIGHTS OF EU CITIZENS IN THE UK AND A TWOYEAR TRANSITION PERIOD TO CONSOLIDATE NEW BILATERAL MODALITIES
Tamil-0011-8439	THIS COMPROMISE DIDNT FLY WITH THE RULING TORY LAWMAKERS BECAUSE THE BREXITEERS OF THE PARTY FEEL IT CONCEDES TOO MUCH TO THE EU AND YET REMAINS BOUND BY THE BLOCS RULES
Tamil-0011-8440	SIMULTANEOUSLY PROEU LAWMAKERS ARE FIRMLY AGAINST A HARD BREXIT OR NODEAL BREXIT AND PREFER TO KEEP ALIVE THE CLOSE ECONOMIC TIES TO THE CONTINENT THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE UK
Tamil-0011-8441	JOINED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
Tamil-0011-8442	THE LAST STRAW THAT MADE MSMAYS RESIGNATION ALL BUT INEVITABLE CAME FROM THE OPINION POLLS FOR THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION  MATCHED THIS WEEK BY THE RESULTS  PREDICTING A LANDSLIDE VICTORY AT THE CONSERVATIVE PARTYS COST FOR THE FRESHLY MINTED BREXIT PARTY LED BY NIGEL FARAGE
Tamil-0011-8443	THE SELECTION OF MSMAYS SUCCESSOR IS A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD ISSUE AT THIS POINT
Tamil-0011-8444	LEADING THE PACK OF CONTENDERS IS FORMER FOREIGN SECRETARY BORIS JOHNSON WHO HAS REITERATED HIS COMMITMENT TO SEEING THE UK
Tamil-0011-8445	QUIT THE EU ON OCTOBER THIRTY ONE  THE CURRENT DEADLINE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A DEAL IS AGREED UPON OR NOT
Tamil-0011-8446	OTHERS INCLUDE FORMER BREXIT SECRETARY DOMINIC RAAB WHO SUPPORTS LEAVING THE EU ON WTO TERMS ENVIRONMENT SECRETARY MICHAEL GOVE AND FORMER LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ANDREA LEADSOM
Tamil-0011-8447	THE MORE COMPLEX ISSUE IS WHETHER THE CONSERVATIVE PARTYS NEXT LEADER CAN DEVISE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE FORMULA THAT MINIMISES THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PAIN INFLICTED ON INDIVIDUALS CORPORATIONS AND THE NATIONAL PSYCHE
Tamil-0011-8448	THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT AND FEW AN ORDERLY EXIT WITH A DEAL UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT MSMAY HAS ALLOWED THE OPPOSITION TO THE ONLY DEAL THAT BRUSSELS HAS SIGNED OFF TO CRYSTALLISE A NODEAL EXIT AN ECONOMICALLY AND LEGALLY PAINFUL OUTCOME BUT QUITE POSSIBLE AN ELECTION OR SECOND REFERENDUM THAT MIGHT REVERSE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN DECISION TO LEAVE THE EU POSSIBLE BUT UNCLEAR IF THIS COULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE OCTOBER THIRTY ONE DEADLINE OR A FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE DEADLINE BEYOND THE DATE AN EVENT THAT SOME CONSIDER LIKELY
Tamil-0011-8449	NO MATTER HOW THE POLITICS OF THIS TROUBLED NATION TURNS IT IS THE RESOLUTION OF BREXIT AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN NATIVIST IMPULSES AND THE EXISTING LIBERAL ORDER THAT THE WORLD IS WATCHING
Tamil-0011-8450	SELDOM DOES SOMEONE ON THE LOSING SIDE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE SATISFIED ABOUT IN DEFEAT AS TAMIL NADU CHIEF MINISTER EDAPPADI KPALANISWAMI
Tamil-0011-8451	THE MASSIVE DRUBBING SUFFERED BY THE AIADMKBJP ALLIANCE IN THE STATE MAY BE A NOTABLE OUTCOME OF THE LOK SABHA ELECTION BUT THE POSITIVE TAKEAWAY FOR HIM IS THAT HE REMAINS IN OFFICE AND WITH ADDED SHEEN OF STABILITY
Tamil-0011-8452	BY GARNERING NINE OUT OF THE TWENTY TWO ASSEMBLY CONSTITUENCIES THAT HAD BYELECTIONS ALONGSIDE THE LOK SABHA POLLS THE RULING AIADMK HAS GOT ENOUGH SEATS TO STAVE OFF THE PROSPECT OF LOSING ITS MAJORITY IN THE TWO THIRTY FOURMEMBER HOUSE
Tamil-0011-8453	ALTHOUGH IT LOST THIRTEEN SEATS TO THE OPPOSITION DMK ITS TALLY WENT UP TO ONE TWENTY THREE  FIVE ABOVE THE REQUISITE MAJORITY
Tamil-0011-8454	ANOTHER UPSHOT IS THAT TTVDHINAKARAN THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGER TO THE AIADMK FOR JAYALALITHAAS LEGACY ENDED UP LOSING SO BADLY THAT HE MAY NOT BE IN A POSITION TO WEAN AWAY ANY MORE LEGISLATORS FROM THE PARTY JOINTLY LED BY MRPALANISWAMI AND DEPUTY CHIEF MINISTER OPANNEERSELVAM
Tamil-0011-8455	WITH NONE OF MRDHINAKARANS CANDIDATES COMING CLOSE TO VICTORY IN ANY OF THE LOK SABHA OR ASSEMBLY CONSTITUENCIES THE POSSIBILITY OF SOCALLED FENCESITTERS LEANING TOWARDS HIM HAS DISAPPEARED
Tamil-0011-8456	IN TWO YEARS MRPALANISWAMI HAS SURVIVED CHALLENGES TO HIS LEADERSHIP FIRST FROM MRPANNEERSELVAM WHO LATER BECAME HIS ALLY IN A JOINT ATTEMPT TO KEEP OUT JAYALALITHAAS FRIEND VKSASIKALA AND LATER MRDHINAKARAN
Tamil-0011-8457	HE SURVIVED THE FIRST CRISIS BY STRIKING A DEAL WITH MRPANNEERSELVAM AND HIS SUPPORTERS
Tamil-0011-8458	I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT BACK WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL AND THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT OUR FUTURES THERE WAS A HUGE EMPHASIS ON GOING TO UNIVERSITY IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD PAYING JOB IN THE FUTURE
Tamil-0011-8459	ALL THE STATS WERE THROWN AT US THAT ON AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DEGREE MAKE ALMOST ONE MILLION DOLLAR MORE IN THEIR LIFETIME 
Tamil-0011-8460	AND THAT STUDENT DEBT WOULDNT BE THAT DIFFICULT TO PAY BACK
Tamil-0011-8461	THE ONE THING THEY FORGET TO MENTION IN THAT FIRST STAT  HALF THE PEOPLE WHO DONT GO TO UNI SIMPLY CANT BE BOTHERED TO PUT ANY REAL EFFORT INTO THEIR FUTURE
Tamil-0011-8462	IF YOU JUST TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WITHIN THE SECTION OF NONUNI GOERS THEYD PROBABLY MAKE MORE MONEY ON AVERAGE THAN GRADUATES
Tamil-0011-8463	HAVE A SIT ON THAT AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
Tamil-0011-8464	THE POINT OF THIS BEING THAT YOU SHOULDNT ALWAYS LISTEN TO OTHERS OPINIONS NO MATTER HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE THEY MAY HAVE 
Tamil-0011-8465	WHAT WORKED FOR THEM MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU AND WHAT THEY FAILED AT MAY MAKE THEM JEALOUS OF YOU

Tamil-0015-8561	YSR HAD HELPED THE CONGRESS WIN MORE THAN THREE DOZEN LOK SABHA MEMBERS FROM THE UNDIVIDED STATE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND NINE THE SINGLE BIGGEST CONTINGENT FOR THE PARTY FROM ANY STATE AND WHICH POWERED THE UPA ONE AND UPA TWO IN PARLIAMENT
Tamil-0015-8562	YSJAGAN MOHAN REDDY YSRS SON SOUGHT THE TOP POST IN THE STATE AFTER HIS FATHERS DEATH BUT THE CONGRESS HIGH COMMAND WHICH HAS A HIGH TOLERANCE FOR DEMANDS OF OFFSPRINGS OF PARTY LEADERS RAISED THE BAR IN THIS INSTANCE
Tamil-0015-8563	MRREDDY LAUNCHED HIS REGIONAL OUTFIT THE YSRCP CLEANED OUT THE CONGRESS WHICH WAS REELING UNDER THE ADVERSE AFTEREFFECTS OF THE BIFURCATION OF ANDHRA PRADESH AND HAS NOW WON DECISIVELY ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE NINE YEARS LATER
Tamil-0015-8564	IN ODISHA MRPATNAIKS VICTORY IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS OVERWHELMING BUT THE BJP WHICH HAS WON EIGHT OF THE TWENTY ONE LOK SABHA SEATS FROM THE STATE IS SITTING IN THE WINGS HAVING DISPLACED THE CONGRESS AS THE PRINCIPAL OPPOSITION PARTY
Tamil-0015-8565	THE RESULTS IN ODISHA ARE ALSO INDICATIVE OF A NEW POLITICAL TREND WHEREBY VOTERS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS
Tamil-0015-8566	MADHYA PRADESH RAJASTHAN AND CHHATTISGARH STATES THAT CHOSE THE CONGRESS OVER THE BJP IN ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS ONLY MONTHS AGO SWUNG RIGHT BACK TO THE SAFFRON PARTY IN THE LOK SABHA POLLS
Tamil-0015-8567	IN ODISHA EVEN WITH BOTH ELECTIONS BEING HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS DEMARCATION IS STARK THOUGH THE BJD STILL GOT MORE SEATS THAN THE BJP
Tamil-0015-8568	IN MRREDDYS CASE HE SWEPT THE LOK SABHA POLLS TOO INDICATING THAT A HARDWORKING REGIONAL LEADER WITH EFFECTIVE POLITICAL MESSAGING CAN RESIST TOPDOWN HYPERNATIONALISM
Tamil-0015-8569	THE DEFINITIVE NATURE OF THE BHARATIYA JANATA PARTYS VICTORY IN THE SEVENTEEN TH GENERAL ELECTION MARKS AN UNMISTAKABLE INFLECTION POINT IN THE JOURNEY OF THE REPUBLIC
Tamil-0015-8570	IF THE SIXTEENTH GENERAL ELECTION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CATAPULTED THE BJP AS THE PRIMARY POLE OF INDIAN POLITICS RELEGATING THE CONGRESS TO A DISTANT SECOND TWENTY NINETEEN ESTABLISHES IT AS THE OVERARCHING HEGEMON
Tamil-0015-8571	FOR GOOD REASONS THIS RESULT IS BEING VIEWED AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODIS PERSONA AND HIS IMPRINT ON THIS VICTORY IS DISTINCTIVE
Tamil-0015-8572	BUT IT WILL BE A FOLLY TO IGNORE THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL REASONS THAT MADE THIS VICTORY POSSIBLE AND ITS SWEEP SO DEEP AND WIDE
Tamil-0015-8573	IT TAKES STRONG PERSONALITIES TO POPULARISE AN IDEA BUT IT IS THOSE IDEAS THAT OUTLIVE PERSONALITIES THAT DEFINE THE COURSE OF A PEOPLE OR A NATION
Tamil-0015-8574	THE OUTCOME HENCE MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ELECTORAL ENDORSEMENT OF HINDUTVA OR HINDU NATIONALISM THE CREED THAT GUIDED THE BJP AND ITS FOREBEARS FOR NEARLY A CENTURY SINCE VINAYAK DAMODAR SAVARKAR WROTE THE TREATISE BY THE SAME TITLE
Tamil-0015-8575	MRMODI WHO COUNTS SAVARKAR AS A CRITICAL INFLUENCE HAS BEEN THE CATALYST AND THE ALCHEMIST OF THE TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY INDIA IMAGINES ITSELF
Tamil-0015-8576	IN RECESS IF NOT IN IRREVERSIBLE DECLINE IS THE IDEA OF INDIA THAT HAD GROWN FROM THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT AND HAD PREVAILED FOR MOST PART OF THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC
Tamil-0015-8577	CHAMPIONED BY THE FIRST PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA JAWAHARLAL NEHRU IT SOUGHT INSPIRATION FROM THE MILLENNIAOLD CIVILISATION THE VEDAS AND THE UPANISHADS BUT ALSO STRIVED TO BUILD INDIA INTO A MODERN SOCIETY WITH A SCIENTIFIC TEMPER AND LIBERAL VALUES
Tamil-0015-8578	THE IDEA OUTLIVED NEHRU BUT IT HAD BEGUN TO FADE SOON AFTER HIS PASSING
Tamil-0015-8579	NEHRU AND HIS MENTOR MAHATMA GANDHI WERE THE PRIME TARGETS OF DERISION FOR THE PROPONENTS OF HINDUTVA IN THE EARLY YEARS
Tamil-0015-8580	WITH THE TWENTY NINETEEN RESULT HINDUTVA HAS PUSHED NEHRUVIAN SECULARISM TO THE MARGINS OF INDIAN POLITICS
Tamil-0015-8581	THE CONGRESS NOW LED BY NEHRUS GREATGRANDSON RAHUL GANDHI DID BETTER THAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT NOT ENOUGH TO EVEN BE RECOGNISED AS THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION IN THE LOK SABHA
Tamil-0015-8582	THE TWENTY NINETEEN VERDICT HAS ALSO DISMANTLED SOCIAL JUSTICE POLITICS IN UTTAR PRADESH AND BIHAR TWO STATES THAT TOGETHER SEND ONE TWENTY MEMBERS TO THE LOK SABHA
Tamil-0015-8583	THE RISE OF HINDUTVA SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAD A PARALLEL  A NEW WAVE OF BACKWARD CASTE MOBILISATION IN PARTS OF NORTHERN AND WESTERN INDIA WHICH QUESTIONED THE NEHRUVIAN ELITES GRIP ON POWER
Tamil-0015-8584	WHILE PARTIES BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE POLITICS OR REGIONAL PRIDE WEAKENED THE CONGRESS THEY ALSO VIEWED THE BJP WITH SCEPTICISM DESPITE THEIR OCCASIONAL ASSOCIATION WITH IT
Tamil-0015-8585	THROUGH DEFT COALITIONBUILDING THE BJP USED MANY NONCONGRESS OUTFITS TO FURTHER ITS OWN GROWTH AND GOBBLED THEM UP IN SEVERAL STATES SUCH AS GUJARAT
Tamil-0015-8586	REMEMBER I SAID ABOVE THAT HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO DONT GO TO UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE JUST CANT BE BOTHERED TO DO ANYTHING AMBITIOUS IN THE FIRST PLACE
Tamil-0015-8587	WELL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE GOT THEIR OWN LITTLE SUBHEADING RIGHT HERE
Tamil-0015-8588	THE REASON THEY DONT TAKE ACTION IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANT BE BOTHERED TO DO SO 
Tamil-0015-8589	IT SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH EFFORT AND THEYD RATHER SKATE BY THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT HAVING TO LIFT TOO MANY FINGERS THAN ACTUALLY GO OUT ENJOY THEIR LIFE AND MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES

Tamil-0017-8629	THE SATELLITE DOES NOT HAVE PASSIVE MICROWAVE SENSORS THAT DETECT THE RADIATION NATURALLY EMITTED BY THE ATMOSPHERE OR REFLECTED BY OBJECTS ON THE GROUND
Tamil-0017-8630	INSTEAD RISAT TWO B WILL BE TRANSMITTING HUNDREDS OF MICROWAVE PULSES EACH SECOND TOWARDS THE GROUND AND RECEIVING THE SIGNALS REFLECTED BY THE OBJECTS USING RADAR
Tamil-0017-8631	THE MOISTURE AND TEXTURE OF THE OBJECT WILL DETERMINE THE STRENGTH OF THE MICROWAVE SIGNAL THAT GETS REFLECTED

Tamil-0017-8633	THE RISAT TWO B SATELLITE USES XBAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR WAS DEVELOPED INDIGENOUSLY
Tamil-0017-8634	UNLIKE THE CBAND THAT WAS USED BY RISATONE  THE SHORTER WAVELENGTH OF THE XBAND ALLOWS FOR HIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGERY FOR TARGET IDENTIFICATION AND DISCRIMINATION
Tamil-0017-8635	SINCE IT HAS HIGH RESOLUTION THE SATELLITE WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT OBJECTS WITH DIMENSIONS OF AS LITTLE AS A METRE
Tamil-0017-8636	THIS CAPACITY TO STUDY SMALL OBJECTS AND ALSO MOVEMENT COULD BE USEFUL FOR SURVEILLANCE
Tamil-0017-8637	AS KSIVAN ISRO CHAIRMAN AND SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF SPACE HAD SAID LAST MONTH THE SATELLITE COULD BE USED FOR CIVIL AND STRATEGIC PURPOSES
Tamil-0017-8638	RISAT TWO B WILL HAVE AN INCLINED ORBIT OF THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES WHICH WILL ALLOW MORE FREQUENT OBSERVATIONS OVER THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT

Tamil-0017-8641	BUT WHILE THE WITHDRAWAL WAS UNDER WAY LAST WEEK HOUTHIS WHO ARE REPORTEDLY GETTING SUPPORT FROM IRAN CARRIED OUT A DRONE ATTACK ON A SAUDI PIPELINE AND IN RETALIATION RIYADH LAUNCHED AIRSTRIKES ON SANAA THE CAPITAL CITY CONTROLLED BY THE REBELS KILLING AT LEAST SIX CIVILIANS INCLUDING CHILDREN

Tamil-0017-8646	IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PIPELINE WAS ATTACKED THE SAUDIS BLAMED IRAN FOR ORDERING IT AN ALLEGATION WHICH BOTH TEHRAN AND THE HOUTHIS HAVE REFUTED
Tamil-0017-8647	WHETHER IRAN WAS ACTUALLY BEHIND THE ATTACK OR NOT THE INCIDENT AND THE SUBSEQUENT SAUDI AIRSTRIKES SHOW HOW THE YEMENI CONFLICT IS ENTANGLED WITH THE REGIONAL RIVALRY BETWEEN IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA
Tamil-0017-8648	SAUDI ARABIA STARTED ITS YEMEN MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN MARCH TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE GOAL OF DRIVING HOUTHIS OUT OF TERRITORIES THEY CAPTURED

Tamil-0019-8705	THE PROCESS OF DECISIONMAKING IN THE THREEMEMBER COMMISSION ITSELF WAS CALLED INTO QUESTION WITH ONE MEMBER NOTIFYING THE OTHERS THAT HE WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS ON COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS OF THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT UNLESS HIS DISSENT WHEN MADE IS RECORDED IN THE FINAL ORDER
Tamil-0019-8706	THE WISDOM OF HOLDING ELECTIONS OVER STRETCHED PHASES NEEDS TO BE REVISITED IN LIGHT OF THIS YEARS EXPERIENCE AND FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS
Tamil-0019-8707	AND RESTORING ITS REPUTATION AND INTEGRITY MUST BE THE COMMISSIONS IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
Tamil-0019-8708	SOME SELFREFLECTION IS CALLED FOR AS THE COUNTRY CONCLUDES A BITTERLY FOUGHT ELECTION DURING WHICH BOUNDARIES OF CIVIL PUBLIC DEBATE HAVE BEEN CROSSED AND NORMS BREACHED
Tamil-0019-8709	WHAT MAKES TWENTY NINETEEN UNPRECEDENTED IS NOT THAT INAPPROPRIATE WORDS WERE USED AND MISINFORMATION SPREAD BUT THE FACT THAT INDIA WITNESSED AN INCREASING TENDENCY TO NORMALISE THESE
Tamil-0019-8710	IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN CAMPAIGN THE LEADERS OF THE GOVERNMENT PREEMPTED A FACTBASED DEBATE ON ITS PERFORMANCE OF FIVE YEARS BY BLOCKING OR CONTAMINATING OFFICIAL DATA ON JOB GENERATION AND OTHER PARAMETERS AND SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED ELECTIONEERING INTO A FACTFREE ZONE FILLED WITH EMOTIVE AND DIVISIVE ISSUES
Tamil-0019-8711	THIS WAS A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0019-8712	ON THE ONE HAND INFORMED DISCUSSIONS HAVE BECOME DIFFICULT AND ON THE OTHER SOCIAL TENSIONS HAVE RISEN
Tamil-0019-8713	THE OUTCOME ON THURSDAY REMAINS A SUSPENSE BUT THE INCOMING PRIME MINISTER WHOEVER THAT WILL BE MUST TAKE THE INITIATIVE TO RALLY ALL INDIANS AROUND A TRULY INCLUSIVE AND SECULAR NATIONAL AGENDA AS SOON HE OR SHE TAKES OVER
Tamil-0019-8714	IS ONE DECADE OF PEACE ENOUGH TO UNDO THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF A CIVIL WAR THAT LASTED NEARLY THREE DECADES AS SRI LANKA COMPLETES TEN YEARS SINCE THE BRUTAL AND DECISIVE WAR AGAINST TAMIL MILITANTS CAME TO AN END IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE COUNTRY HAS NOT ACHIEVED MUCH TANGIBLE PROGRESS TOWARDS ETHNIC RECONCILIATION ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WARTIME EXCESSES AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THAT INCLUDES A POLITICAL SOLUTION
Tamil-0019-8715	THE FRUITS OF PEACE ARE LIMITED TO THE REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BUT THE PERVASIVE GRIEVANCES OF THE TAMIL MINORITY REMAIN
Tamil-0019-8716	SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION BUT COMPLAINTS ABOUND
Tamil-0019-8717	MANY SAY THEIR LAND CONTINUES TO BE HELD BY THE MILITARY WHICH ALSO CONTROLS HUGE SWATHES OF STATEOWNED LAND
Tamil-0019-8718	MAYBE SOMEBODY HASNT EVEN FAILED AT ALL IN THEIR LIFETIME MAYBE THEYRE SO SCARED OF FAILING THAT THEY HAVENT EVEN TRIED TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS AT ALL
Tamil-0019-8719	I WAS LISTENING TO A SPEECH FROM LES BROWN RECENTLY AND HE EXPLAINED THAT A COMPANY WAS HAVING A MAJOR DOWNSIZING AND THEY WERE OFFERING EMPLOYEES THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN COMPENSATION IF THEY MADE THE CHOICE TO LEAVE THE COMPANY
Tamil-0019-8720	IF THEY DIDNT TAKE THE MONEY THEY WOULD BE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR JOBS AS GETTING NOTHING WHEN THE COMPANY HAD THE DOWNSIZING
Tamil-0019-8721	ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE TO TAKE THE MONEY DID FIFTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE ALLOW THE FEAR OF FAILURE TO STOP THEM FROM DOING ALL THE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO IN LIFE
Tamil-0019-8722	ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
Tamil-0019-8723	TAKING RISKS IN LIFE SHOULDNT BE OPTIONAL 
Tamil-0019-8724	THEYRE IMPORTANT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING GREAT THAT ANYBODYS EVER TRIED TO ACHIEVE CAME THROUGH TAKING A RISK MAYBE THEY RISKED THEIR TIME FOR SOMETHING THEIR MONEY THEIR JOB WHATEVER IT MAY BE
Tamil-0019-8725	BUT THEY DID SO WITH ALL GOOD REASON

Tamil-0021-8764	IMPORTS GREW BY FOUR PERCENT TO DOLLAR FOURTY ONE BILLION IN APRIL ACCELERATING FROM MARCHS ONE PERCENT PACE AS PURCHASES OF CRUDE OIL AND GOLD CONTINUED TO INCREASE
Tamil-0021-8765	WHILE THE NINE PERCENT JUMP IN THE OIL IMPORT BILL FROM MARCHS FIVE PERCENT CAN PARTLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE RISE IN INTERNATIONAL CRUDE PRICES BRENT CRUDE FUTURES FOR INSTANCE ADVANCED SIX PERCENT IN APRIL INDIAS INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR GOLD AS REFLECTED IN THE FIFTY FOUR PERCENT SURGE IN IMPORTS LAST MONTH MUST GIVE POLICYMAKERS CAUSE FOR REFLECTION
Tamil-0021-8766	EXCLUDING OIL AND GOLD HOWEVER IMPORTS SHRANK BY MORE THAN TWO PERCENT LAST MONTH SIGNALLING THAT IMPORT DEMAND IN THE REAL PRODUCTIVE SECTORS IS LARGELY BECALMED
Tamil-0021-8767	AS A RESULT OF MERCHANDISE IMPORTS OUTPACING EXPORTS THE TRADE DEFICIT WIDENED TO A FIVEMONTH HIGH OF DOLLAR FIFTEEN BILLION
Tamil-0021-8768	THE WIDENING TRADE SHORTFALL WILL ADD PRESSURE ON INDIAS BURGEONING CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH AT A PROVISIONAL DOLLAR FIFTY ONE BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL TWENTY EIGHTEENNINETEEN HAD ALREADY SURPASSED THE PRECEDING FINANCIAL YEARS TWELVE MONTH SHORTFALL OF DOLLAR FOURTY EIGHT BILLION
Tamil-0021-8769	WITH STRONGER HEADWINDS AHEAD IN THE FORM OF AN ESCALATING TRADE WAR BETWEEN THE USAND CHINA AND ITS KNOCKON IMPACT ON GLOBAL GROWTH THE OUTLOOK FOR EXPORT DEMAND IS FAR FROM REASSURING
Tamil-0021-8770	ADD THE RISING MILITARY TENSIONS IN WEST ASIA AND ITS POTENTIAL TO FURTHER PUSH UP OIL PRICES AND THE SCOPE TO CONTAIN THE TRADE AND CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS SEEMS SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGING
Tamil-0021-8771	CLEARLY THIS WOULD BE ONE MORE PRESSING CONCERN FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS
Tamil-0021-8772	THE DEATH OF MAHATMA GANDHI LAST EVENING AT NEW DELHI AT THE HANDS OF AN INSENSATE ASSASSIN IN CIRCUMSTANCES TOO TRAGIC FOR REITERATION HAS CAST A DEEP GLOOM OVER THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF WHICH IT WILL NOT BE EASY FOR IT TO RECOVER
Tamil-0021-8773	FOR AS THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA HAS SUGGESTED IN HIS BROADCAST AT NO TIME IN THE LONG AND CHEQUERED HISTORY OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY WERE GANDHIJIS WISE COUNSEL COURAGEOUS GUIDANCE UNEXCELLED FORESIGHT AND IMPERTURBABLE PATIENCE IN THE FACE OF EVENTS THE MOST CALAMITOUS MORE NECESSARY THAN TODAY
Tamil-0021-8774	IT WILL BE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED THAT BUT FOR HIS STEADYING DIRECTION UNERRING JUDGMENT AND A DETERMINATION WHICH ACCEPTED NO DEFEAT THE TURMOIL WHICH BEFELL US IN THE WAKE OF THE PARTITION OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO MENACE US IN AN EVERINCREASING MEASURE
Tamil-0021-8775	THE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF MESSAGES WHICH KEEP THE WIRES AND RADIO OF THE WORLD VIBRATING AT THE MOMENT SHOW HOW DEEPLY GANDHIJI HAS IMPRESSED HUMANITY AS AN APOSTLE OF PEACE AND AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN RIGHTLY HAILED AS THE WORLDS SECOND SAVIOUR
Tamil-0021-8776	WHAT IS THE SECRET OF GANDHIJIS WORLDWIDE FAME AND UNQUESTIONED INFLUENCE FOR ONE THING HIS CULTURE HAD ALL THE TRAITS OF WHAT IS CALLED THE CULTURE OF CHARACTER
Tamil-0021-8777	HE THOUGHT CLOSELY AND SERIOUSLY HE INSISTED ON SEEKING FACT OR TRUTH FOR ONES SELF BOLDLY AND CLEARLY AND NOT MERELY ECHO IT AS HEARSAY HE CHERISHED NOT FASHIONS OR EXPEDIENTS OF THINKING BUT TRUE CONVICTIONS WITH A STRENGTH OF FEELING WHICH NEITHER THE COAXING OF FRIENDS NOR THE RAILLERIES AND THE RAPIER THRUSTS OF OPPONENTS COULD WEAKEN
Tamil-0021-8778	THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER IN WHATEVER CONTINENT COUNTRY OR CLIME HIS ACTIVITY FOR THE TIME BEING LAY  WHETHER IN SOUTH AFRICA SABARMATI OR CHAMPARAN IN THE SUBMONTANE REGION OF BIHAR AMONG THE INDIGO PLANTERS THERE HE CARRIED TO THOSE AMONG WHOM HE WORKED UNQUESTIONABLE CONVICTION THAT HE COULD BE TRUSTED
Tamil-0021-8779	IT WAS BECAUSE HE INSPIRED SUCH TRUST THAT HE PROVED A DETERMINING FORCE IN THE FORMATION OF PUBLIC OPINION
Tamil-0021-8780	HE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MAN OF ACTION NOT OF SWEET WORDS
Tamil-0021-8781	HE HAD FURTHER WHAT MANY OTHERS LACKED A CONSTRUCTIVE FACULTY
Tamil-0021-8782	HE WOULD NOT MERELY DENOUNCE OTHER MEN AND OTHER MEASURES HE WOULD SHOW THEM A WAY AND A METHOD BETTER THAN THEIRS

Tamil-0021-8784	NO WONDER SO MANY LEADERS OF THOUGHT IN EUROPE AND AMERICA HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY STRUCK AND INFLUENCED BY HIS IDEAS OF PLAIN LIVING AND HIGH THINKING NONVIOLENCE EVEN IN THE FACE OF EXTREME PROVOCATION AND A LIFE OF SERVICE TO ALL

Tamil-0021-8787	NOT HAVING STRONG CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN LIFE
Tamil-0021-8788	ITS INCREDIBLY COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO LACK SELFCONFIDENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOURE GROWING UP AND THERES A LOT OF PRESSURE ON YOU FROM YOUR FRIENDS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS LOOK AND ACT A CERTAIN WAY TO FIT IN
Tamil-0021-8789	AND THATS WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD IF YOU WERENT CONSIDERED COOL IN HIGH SCHOOL OR PEOPLE GAVE YOU A HARD TIME BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU LOOKED YOUR CONFIDENCE FROM THAT POINT ON WILL BE AT AN ALL TIME LOW
Tamil-0021-8790	NATURALLY OF COURSE IT WILL BE

Tamil-0022-8799	GANDHIJI HAS DONE HIS DUTY HE HAS WARNED US OF THE PERILS AND THE TEMPTATIONS THAT CONFRONT US AND HE HAS DELIVERED HIS SOUL UNTO HIS MAKER
Tamil-0022-8800	IT NOW REMAINS FOR US TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE HAVE BEEN REMINDED IN THE BROADCASTS OF THE PRIME MINISTER AND SARDAR PATEL
Tamil-0022-8801	LET US FIRST GET THE ATMOSPHERE RID OF THE POISON WHICH PERMEATES IT LET US FACE AS THE PRIME MINISTER EXHORTS US TO DO ALL THE PERILS THAT ENCOMPASS US AND THEY ARE MANY AND GRAVE  NOT MADLY OR BADLY BUT IN THE WAY THAT OUR BELOVED TEACHER TAUGHT US TO FACE THEM
Tamil-0022-8802	LET NOT ANGER BECLOUD OUR VISION NOR UNREASONING PASSION DISTORT OUR MINDS
Tamil-0022-8803	NOT FOR US NOW PETTY PREJUDICES AND PARTY INTRIGUES AND JEALOUSIES

Tamil-0022-8805	ONLY THUS MAY WE UPHOLD THE REPUTATION WHICH GANDHIJI CLAIMED FOR OUR COUNTRY AND INCESSANTLY STROVE TO SUSTAINTHE REPUTATION SUCH AS THE INDIA OF ASOKA AND AKBAR ENJOYED AMONG THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD IN THEIR TIME
Tamil-0022-8806	ON MAY TWENTY THREE AS THE RESULTS OF THE INDIAN ELECTIONS EMERGE IN EUROPE THE WORLDS SECOND LARGEST DEMOCRATIC ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL GET UNDER WAY
Tamil-0022-8807	MORE THAN FOUR TWENTY FIVE MILLION VOTERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS THAT WILL TAKE PLACE OVER A FOURDAY PERIOD TO SELECT SEVEN FIFTY ONE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FOR A FIVEYEAR TERM

Tamil-0022-8809	THOUSANDS OF CANDIDATES FROM HUNDREDS OF PARTIES AS WELL AS INDEPENDENTS WILL SEEK VOTES AND THE WINNERS WILL FORM CROSSNATIONAL GROUPINGS IN THE HOUSE BASED ON THEIR POLITICAL IDEOLOGY
Tamil-0022-8810	WITH TURNOUT USUALLY LOW FOURTY THREE PERCENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN PREDICTIONS CAN BE TRICKY BUT EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT FARRIGHT AND EUROSCEPTIC PARTIES WILL MAKE GAINS
Tamil-0022-8811	LAST MONTH ITALYS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FIGUREHEAD FOR THE FAR RIGHT IN EUROPE MATTEO SALVINI LAUNCHED THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE OF PEOPLE AND NATIONS ALONGSIDE ALLIES FROM GERMANY TO DENMARK ON A PLATFORM INVOKING TOUGHER IMMIGRATION RULES AND IN SOME CASES EUROSCEPTICISM UNITING PARTIES THAT HAD ONCE BEEN SPLIT BETWEEN GROUPINGS
Tamil-0022-8812	IN BRITAIN THE APPEAL OF ANTIEUROPEAN SENTIMENT HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE SUCCESS OF THE BREXIT PARTY FORMED IN JANUARY BY FORMER UK INDEPENDENCE PARTY HEAD NIGEL FARAGE  IT IS PROJECTED TO WIN A THIRTY FOUR PERCENT SHARE OF THE VOTE
Tamil-0022-8813	IN GERMANY THE RIGHTWING ALTERNATIVE FR DEUTSCHLAND IS EXPECTED TO MAKE GAINS WHILE IN FRANCE THE RIGHTWING NATIONAL RALLY FORMER NATIONAL FRONT COULD TO DO BETTER THAN PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRONS EN MARCHE
Tamil-0022-8814	THERE IS A RISK THAT CENTRERIGHT AND CENTRELEFT COALITIONS WILL FAIL TO COMMAND A JOINT MAJORITY
Tamil-0022-8815	THE TEMPTATION WILL BE FOR CENTRIST PARTIES TO SEE THESE ELECTIONS AS YET ANOTHER SIGN THAT POPULISM IS ON THE RISE AND A CAUSE THEY MUST IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PANDER TO
Tamil-0022-8816	IN BRITAIN THIS HAS CERTAINLY BEEN THE CASE WITH THE RIGHTWARD LUNGE OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHILE IN GERMANY THE CENTRELEFT SPD HAS TOUGHENED ITS STANCE ON ASYLUMSEEKERS
Tamil-0022-8817	YET THIS WOULD BE THE WRONG MESSAGE TO TAKE
Tamil-0022-8818	WHAT IS UNDER WAY IS VASTLY MORE COMPLEX
Tamil-0022-8819	IT IS CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING ALTERNATIVES AMID STAGNATING WAGES AND LIVING STANDARDS WITH MANY SHUNNING MAINSTREAM PARTIES IN THEIR QUEST  BUT TO INFER THAT ALL SEE POPULISM AS THE ROUTE AHEAD WOULD BE NAIVE

Tamil-0023-8835	MAKING MATTERS WORSE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE USAIMS TO PIN ON THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY FORCES BLAME FOR ATTACKS ON TWO SAUDI ARABIAN OIL TANKERS OVER THE WEEKEND
Tamil-0023-8836	USNATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTONS REMARK THAT ANY ATTACK ON UNITED STATES INTERESTS OR THOSE OF ITS ALLIES WILL BE MET WITH UNRELENTING FORCE GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GROUND IS BEING PREPARED BY THE US AIDED BY SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL FOR AN ESCALATION
Tamil-0023-8837	GIVEN THE SIGNS OF A GATHERING STORM INDIA MUST CONSIDER NOT ONLY ITS OWN INTERESTS IN TERMS OF ITS TIES WITH IRAN AND WITH THE USAND ITS ALLIES BUT ALSO ITS POSITION AS A REGIONAL POWER
Tamil-0023-8838	THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTRY COMMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE A DECISION ON IRANIAN OIL IMPORTS AFTER THE ELECTIONS APPEARED TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO BUY TIME
Tamil-0023-8839	THE TRUTH IS THAT INDIAN OIL IMPORTERS HAVE ALREADY STOPPED PLACING ORDERS FOR IRANIAN OIL IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE USDIKTAT ON ZEROING OUT IMPORTS
Tamil-0023-8840	INDIA HAD BEEN IMPORTING ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF ITS OIL REQUIREMENTS FROM IRAN AND THE LOSSES IN TERMS OF FINDING ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS IN THE FACE OF RISING OIL PRICES ARE PILING UP
Tamil-0023-8841	NEWS REPORTS ALSO INDICATE THAT DESPITE A USWAIVER ON THE CHABAHAR PORT BANKS IN INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN THAT PLANNED TO FINANCE TRADE THROUGH THE PORT ARE NOW BEING RESTRICTED BY USSANCTIONS
Tamil-0023-8842	INSTEAD OF BEING A MUTE SPECTATOR TO THE CRISIS THAT IS BUILDING FOR INDIAS ENERGY BILL AS WELL AS FOR REGIONAL STABILITY NEW DELHI MUST TAKE THE CHALLENGE HEADON
Tamil-0023-8843	ONE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ENSURING THAT IRAN DOES NOT FEEL COMPELLED TO WALK OUT OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL AND TO JOINTLY BUILD A SANCTIONSIMMUNE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO FACILITATE IRANIAN TRADE

Tamil-0027-8988	THIS WAS A CLASH BETWEEN THE LEAGUES TWO MOST SUCCESSFUL TEAMS AND THERE WAS LITTLE TO SEPARATE THEM IN THE END
Tamil-0027-8989	ALL FOUR OF MUMBAIS TITLES HAVE ARRIVED IN THE LAST SEVEN SEASONS AND KEY TO THAT CONTINUED SUCCESS HAS BEEN THE RETENTION OF A STRONG CORE OF PLAYERS
Tamil-0027-8990	SIMILAR TO HOW I MENTIONED MONEY ABOVE PEOPLE DO THE SAME THING BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT 
Tamil-0027-8991	THEYLL SAY THAT ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO START A BUSINESS OR START WORKING OUT BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT
Tamil-0027-8992	NORMALLY MONEY WOULD BE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS 
Tamil-0027-8993	BUT THERES ALSO OTHER FACTORS THAT GO INTO BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE EQUIPMENT YOU NEED
Tamil-0027-8994	THE SOLUTION IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS BEFORE 
Tamil-0027-8995	A LOT OF THE EQUIPMENT YOU MAY THINK YOU NEED YOU PROBABLY DONT 
Tamil-0027-8996	YOU COULD EASILY START WITH A LOT LESS AND THATS WHY ITS STILL POSSIBLE TO TAKE ACTION ON YOUR DREAMS IN THE CURRENT SITUATION YOURE IN

Tamil-0033-9193	THE FINAL MONTH OF FINANCIAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEENNINETEEN HAS GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT SOME REASON FOR CHEER
Tamil-0033-9194	TARGETS FOR INDIRECT TAX COLLECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED FOR THE LAST YEAR BUT COLLECTIONS FROM THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IN APRIL FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN MARCH SCALED A NEW HIGH
Tamil-0033-9195	THE GST INFLOWS OF RUPEES ONE POINT TWO LAKH CRORE IN APRIL ARE THE HIGHEST RECORDED SINCE THE TAX REGIME WAS INTRODUCED IN JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN
Tamil-0033-9196	THEY REPRESENT AN INCREASE OF OVER TEN PERCENT COMPARED TO THE SAME MONTH A YEAR AGO AND OVER FIFTEEN PERCENT BUOYANCY OVER THE AVERAGE MONTHLY GST COLLECTIONS IN TWENTY EIGHTEENNINETEEN OF RUPEES NINETY NINE CRORE

Tamil-0033-9198	THE GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH DID SLOW DOWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEENNINETEEN OWING TO DECLINING PRIVATE CONSUMPTION GROWTH A TEPID INCREASE IN FIXED INVESTMENTS AND MUTED EXPORTS
Tamil-0033-9199	THE HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE LATEST GST NUMBERS ARE A HARBINGER OF BETTER GROWTH MOMENTUM FOR TWENTY NINETEENTWENTY
Tamil-0033-9200	THE GROWTH RATE OF THE ECONOMY FELL FROM EIGHT PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO SEVEN PERCENT IN THE SECOND AND SIX PERCENT IN THE THIRD SO ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE FINAL QUARTER NUMBERS DUE AT THE END OF MAY SHOULD PROVIDE SOME SUCCOUR
Tamil-0033-9201	HEALTHIER GST COLLECTIONS IF SUSTAINED WILL ALSO MEAN LESS PRESSURE ON THE CENTRE TO COVER ITS FISCAL DEFICIT
Tamil-0033-9202	THERE WAS A FARMER WHO SOLD A POUND OF BUTTER TO A BAKER

Tamil-0034-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0034-9211	THE APRIL GST NUMBERS HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO MANY EXPERTS GIVEN THE LACKLUSTRE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WITNESSED ACROSS MANY SECTORS IN RECENT MONTHS WHICH SHOULD NORMALLY HAVE IMPACTED TAX COLLECTIONS ADVERSELY
Tamil-0034-9212	THIS PERPLEXING TREND MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASING COMPLIANCE AMONG BUSINESSES AMIDST THE AGGRESSIVE PUSH BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES TO WIDEN THE TAX BASE
Tamil-0034-9213	GST FILINGS FOR INSTANCE WERE THE HIGHEST IN MARCH THIS YEAR
Tamil-0034-9214	HOWEVER THE APRIL SURGE HAS OCCURRED DESPITE A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GSTR THREE B RETURNS FILED BY BUSINESSES FROM SEVENTY FIVE LAKH IN MARCH TO SEVENTY TWO LAKH IN APRIL
Tamil-0034-9215	IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE DISAGGREGATED DATA IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT TAX RATE CUTS BY THE GST COUNCIL IN DECEMBER TOO MAY HAVE SPURRED HIGHER VOLUMES FOR SOME GOODS AND SERVICES
Tamil-0034-9216	THE RUSH TO PAY TAX ARREARS AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR MAY HAVE BEEN ANOTHER SEASONAL FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO BETTER TAX COLLECTION DURING THE LAST MONTH
Tamil-0034-9217	ENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE TAXMAN TO COLLECT MORE REVENUE FROM REGISTERED TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FILING RETURNS COULD BE YET ANOTHER FACTOR
Tamil-0034-9218	IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO ASSUME THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A SECULAR TREND
Tamil-0034-9219	ONE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION OF THE GST REGIME ONCE THE ELECTION SEASON IS OVER
Tamil-0034-9220	A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF BUSINESSES HAVE ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE TAX NET SINCE THE ADVENT OF THE GST
Tamil-0034-9221	IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE GREATER COMPLIANCE THERE MUST BE EFFORTS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMALL FIRMS TO REMAIN IN THE TAX NET BY CUTTING DOWN THE TIME AND ENERGY REQUIRED TO FILL MYRIAD TAX RETURNS
Tamil-0034-9222	A NUDGE WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO THE STICK
Tamil-0034-9223	MASOOD AZHARS LISTING AS A DESIGNATED TERRORIST BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AT LONG LAST CLOSES AN IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN INDIAS QUEST TO BRING THE JAISHEMOHAMMAD CHIEF TO JUSTICE
Tamil-0034-9224	HE ELUDED THE DESIGNATION FOR TWENTY YEARS DESPITE HIS RELEASE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE IN EXCHANGE FOR HOSTAGES AFTER THE ICEIGHT ONE FOUR HIJACK AND HIS LEADERSHIP OF THE JEM AS IT CARRIED OUT DOZENS OF DEADLY ATTACKS IN INDIA INCLUDING THE PARLIAMENT ATTACK OF TWO THOUSAND TWO ONE  AND MORE RECENT ONES LIKE THE PATHANKOT AIRBASE ATTACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE PULWAMA POLICE CONVOY BOMBING THIS YEAR
Tamil-0034-9225	CHINAS OPPOSITION TO THE LISTING HAS LONG BEEN A THORN IN INDIAS SIDE GIVEN THE TOLL AZHAR AND THE JEM HAVE EXACTED AND BEIJINGS VETO OF THE LISTING THREE TIMES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD DRIVEN A WEDGE IN INDIACHINA RELATIONS
Tamil-0034-9226	DESPITE THE FRUSTRATION OVER CHINAS LAST HOLD ON A PROPOSAL MOVED BY THE US THE UK AND FRANCE JUST WEEKS AFTER PULWAMA THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE WELL TO APPROACH BEIJING WITH WHAT THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS CALLED PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE
Tamil-0034-9227	THERE IS MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT HOWEVER OVER THE FINAL LISTING RELEASED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL WITH NO MENTION OF MRAZHARS ROLE IN ANY OF THE ATTACKS AGAINST INDIA OR DIRECTING THE INSURGENCY IN JAMMU AND KASHMIR
Tamil-0034-9228	A SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO PULWAMA WHICH WAS IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS ALSO DROPPED PRESUMABLY TO EFFECT CHINAS CHANGE OF MIND ON THE ISSUE
Tamil-0034-9229	PAKISTANS CLAIMS OF A VICTORY IN THIS ARE HARDLY CREDIBLE MASOOD AZHAR IS ONE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWELVE SIXTY SEVENSANCTIONED TERRORISTS WHO HAVE PAKISTANI NATIONALITY AND MORE ARE BASED THERE WHICH IS HARDLY A SITUATION THAT GIVES IT CAUSE FOR PRIDE
Tamil-0034-9230	IT IS NECESSARY TO RECOGNISE THAT INDIAS EFFORTS AND THOSE OF ITS PARTNERS IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH A UNSC DESIGNATION AT ITS TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN ISIL AND ALQAEDA SANCTIONS COMMITTEE
Tamil-0034-9231	THE FOCUS MUST NOW MOVE TO ENSURING ITS FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN PAKISTAN
Tamil-0034-9232	BUT THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE
Tamil-0034-9233	PAKISTANS ACTIONS AGAINST OTHERS ON THE TWELVE SIXTY SEVEN LIST HAVE BEEN FAR FROM EFFECTIVE AND IN MANY CASES OBSTRUCTIONIST

Tamil-0034-9236	IN ANCIENT TIMES A KING HAD A BOULDER PLACED ON A ROADWAY 
Tamil-0034-9237	HE THEN HID HIMSELF AND WATCHED TO SEE IF ANYONE WOULD MOVE THE BOULDER OUT OF THE WAY 
Tamil-0034-9238	SOME OF THE KINGS WEALTHIEST MERCHANTS AND COURTIERS CAME BY AND SIMPLY WALKED AROUND IT
Tamil-0034-9239	MANY PEOPLE LOUDLY BLAMED THE KING FOR NOT KEEPING THE ROADS CLEAR BUT NONE OF THEM DID ANYTHING ABOUT GETTING THE STONE OUT OF THE WAY
Tamil-0034-9240	A PEASANT THEN CAME ALONG CARRYING A LOAD OF VEGETABLES 
Tamil-0034-9241	UPON APPROACHING THE BOULDER THE PEASANT LAID DOWN HIS BURDEN AND TRIED TO PUSH THE STONE OUT OF THE ROAD AFTER MUCH PUSHING AND STRAINING HE FINALLY SUCCEEDED
Tamil-0034-9242	AFTER THE PEASANT WENT BACK TO PICK UP HIS VEGETABLES HE NOTICED A PURSE LYING IN THE ROAD WHERE THE BOULDER HAD BEEN
Tamil-0034-9243	THE PURSE CONTAINED MANY GOLD COINS AND A NOTE FROM THE KING EXPLAINING THAT THE GOLD WAS FOR THE PERSON WHO REMOVED THE BOULDER FROM THE ROADWAY
Tamil-0034-9244	MORAL OF THE STORY EVERY OBSTACLE WE COME ACROSS IN LIFE GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHILST THE LAZY COMPLAIN THE OTHERS ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THEIR KIND HEARTS GENEROSITY AND WILLINGNESS TO GET THINGS DONE

Tamil-0035-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0035-9245	IT WILL TAKE CONSTANT FOCUS FROM NEW DELHI AND A PUSH FROM THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY TO ENSURE THAT MASOOD AZHAR IS NOT JUST STARVED OF FUNDS ARMS AND AMMUNITION AS MANDATED BUT THAT HE IS PROSECUTED IN PAKISTAN FOR THE ACTS OF TERROR HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
Tamil-0035-9246	AZHAR AND HIS JEM MUST LOSE ALL CAPACITY TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE BORDER
Tamil-0035-9247	GLOBAL TERROR FINANCING WATCHDOG FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE WILL ALSO BE WATCHING PAKISTANS NEXT MOVES CLOSELY AHEAD OF A DECISION THAT COULD COME AS EARLY AS IN JUNE ON WHETHER TO BLACKLIST PAKISTAN OR KEEP IT ON THE GREYLIST
Tamil-0035-9248	BOTH FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL PRESSURE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ON ISLAMABAD TO BRING THE HARDFOUGHT DESIGNATION OF MASOOD AZHAR TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION
Tamil-0035-9249	THE DEATH OF FIFTEEN SECURITY PERSONNEL IN A LANDMINE ATTACK IN GADCHIROLI ON WEDNESDAY IS ANOTHER GRIM REMINDER OF THE INDIAN STATES CONTINUED FAILURE TO CRUSH NAXALISM
Tamil-0035-9250	LESS THAN A MONTH AGO A LEGISLATOR AND SOME SECURITY PERSONNEL LOST THEIR LIVES IN A SIMILAR ATTACK IN THE NEIGHBOURING STATE OF CHHATTISGARH AHEAD OF POLLING
Tamil-0035-9251	THAT THIS ATTACK SHOULD OCCUR DESPITE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIRTY COMPANIES OF THE CENTRAL RESERVE POLICE FORCE  A COMPANY COMPRISES ONE THIRTY FIVE PERSONNEL  AND THIRTEEN COMPANIES OF THE STATE RESERVE POLICE FORCE AS WELL AS FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PERSONNEL OF THE LOCAL POLICE IN GADCHIROLI AND NEIGHBOURING CHANDRAPUR DISTRICT SHOWS NOT ONLY THE AUDACITY OF THE PERPETRATORS BUT ALSO THE UNPREPAREDNESS OF THE SECURITY FORCES
Tamil-0035-9252	A QUICK RESPONSE TEAM WAS GOING DOWN THE ROAD TO DADPUR IN KURKHEDA WHERE EXTREMISTS HAD SET FIRE TO THREE DOZEN VEHICLES OF A ROAD CONSTRUCTION COMPANY EARLIER IN THE DAY WHEN THE EXPLOSION BLASTED THE TEAM TO SMITHEREENS
Tamil-0035-9253	THE EASE WITH WHICH THE EXTREMISTS WERE ABLE TO TORCH SO MANY VEHICLES IS ALARMING AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE RESPONSE TEAM BLITHELY DROVE INTO AN AMBUSH IS A SHOCKING EXAMPLE OF POOR PLANNING
Tamil-0035-9254	THE NAXALS SET THE BAIT AND THE SECURITY FORCES BLINDLY TOOK IT
Tamil-0035-9255	IN THE PROCESS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES INCLUDING LETTING A ROADOPENING TEAM LEAD THE WAY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN IGNORED
Tamil-0035-9256	YET THE AUTHORITIES STILL REMAIN IN A STATE OF DENIAL
Tamil-0035-9257	IT IS NO COINCIDENCE EITHER THAT THE PERPETRATORS CHOSE THE MAHARASHTRA FOUNDATION DAY AFTER THE POLLING IN THE DISTRICT TO SEND THIS VIOLENT MESSAGE
Tamil-0035-9258	THAT THE NAXALS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE REMAIN ON TOP OF THE INTELLIGENCE STAY NIMBLE AND SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD OF THE SECURITY PLANNERS SHOULD BE A MATTER OF DEEP CONCERN
Tamil-0035-9259	IT IS SOME COMFORT THAT THE POLLING PERCENTAGES IN BOTH GADCHIROLI AND NEIGHBOURING CHANDRAPUR HAVE RISEN COMPARED TO THE TWENTY FOURTEEN LOK SABHA ELECTION FROM SEVENTY ONE PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE PERCENT AND FROM SIXTY THREE PERCENT TO SIXTY FOUR PERCENT RESPECTIVELY
Tamil-0035-9260	BUT THE PATH OF THE VOTER TO THE POLLING BOOTH IN THE NAXALDOMINATED DISTRICTS IS STILL PAVED WITH DISINCENTIVES
Tamil-0035-9261	AND THE SECURITY FORCES DEPLOYED IN THE REGION HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO INSTIL IN THEM A GREATER LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE
Tamil-0035-9262	ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE MOST OF THE POLICE PERSONNEL WHO PERISHED IN THIS LATEST ATTACK SEEM TO HAVE BEEN LOCAL CITIZENS
Tamil-0035-9263	WHAT EFFECT COULD THIS HAVE ON THE LARGER PROCESS OF WEANING AWAY THE POPULACE FROM THE NAXALITES REALITY BECKONS
Tamil-0035-9264	EVEN IN THE PREVAILING CIRCUMSTANCES OF A HOSTILE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INDIA CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE THE CHALLENGES OF INTERNAL SECURITY LIGHTLY
Tamil-0035-9265	EVEN THOUGH ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY POLICYMAKERS AS A MAJOR HEALTH CRISIS FEW HAVE CONSIDERED ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT
Tamil-0035-9266	NOW A REPORT FROM THE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION GROUP ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IACG PUTS THE FINANCIAL FALLOUT IN PERSPECTIVE
Tamil-0035-9267	TITLED NO TIME TO WAIT SECURING THE FUTURE FROM DRUG RESISTANT INFECTIONS IT SAYS IN ABOUT THREE DECADES FROM NOW UNCONTROLLED ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE WILL CAUSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SHOCKS ON THE SCALE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTNINE FINANCIAL CRISIS
Tamil-0035-9268	WITH NEARLY TEN MILLION PEOPLE ESTIMATED TO DIE ANNUALLY FROM RESISTANT INFECTIONS BY TWENTY FIFTY HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THE COST OF FOOD PRODUCTION WILL SPIKE WHILE INCOME INEQUALITY WILL WIDEN
Tamil-0035-9269	IN THE WORSTCASE SCENARIO THE WORLD WILL LOSE THREE PERCENT OF ITS ANNUAL GDP BY TWENTY FIFTY WHILE TWENTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE PUSHED INTO EXTREME POVERTY BY TWENTY THIRTY 
Tamil-0035-9270	A MAN FOUND A COCOON OF A BUTTERFLY
Tamil-0035-9271	ONE DAY A SMALL OPENING APPEARED HE SAT AND WATCHED THE BUTTERFLY FOR SEVERAL HOURS AS IT STRUGGLED TO FORCE ITS BODY THROUGH THAT LITTLE HOLE
Tamil-0035-9272	UNTIL IT SUDDENLY STOPPED MAKING ANY PROGRESS AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS STUCK
Tamil-0035-9273	SO THE MAN DECIDED TO HELP THE BUTTERFLY HE TOOK A PAIR OF SCISSORS AND SNIPPED OFF THE REMAINING BIT OF THE COCOON THE BUTTERFLY THEN EMERGED EASILY ALTHOUGH IT HAD A SWOLLEN BODY AND SMALL SHRIVELED WINGS
Tamil-0035-9274	THE MAN DIDNT THINK ANYTHING OF IT AND SAT THERE WAITING FOR THE WINGS TO ENLARGE TO SUPPORT THE BUTTERFLY BUT THAT DIDNT HAPPEN 
Tamil-0035-9275	THE BUTTERFLY SPENT THE REST OF ITS LIFE UNABLE TO FLY CRAWLING AROUND WITH TINY WINGS AND A SWOLLEN BODY
Tamil-0035-9276	DESPITE THE KIND HEART OF THE MAN HE DIDNT UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESTRICTING COCOON AND THE STRUGGLE NEEDED BY THE BUTTERFLY TO GET ITSELF THROUGH THE SMALL OPENING WERE GODS WAY OF FORCING FLUID FROM THE BODY OF THE BUTTERFLY INTO ITS WINGS 
Tamil-0035-9277	TO PREPARE ITSELF FOR FLYING ONCE IT WAS OUT OF THE COCOON
Tamil-0035-9278	MORAL OF THE STORY OUR STRUGGLES IN LIFE DEVELOP OUR STRENGTHS WITHOUT STRUGGLES WE NEVER GROW AND NEVER GET STRONGER SO ITS IMPORTANT FOR US TO TACKLE CHALLENGES ON OUR OWN AND NOT BE RELYING ON HELP FROM OTHERS

Tamil-0037-9316	IT IS HOPED THAT CHINA WILL TAKE THIS UNDERSTANDING FORWARD BEYOND MRXIS SPEECH AND HELP BUILD AN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING NETWORK THAT IS EQUITABLE AND TRANSPARENT ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER STATES
Tamil-0037-9317	WHILE MRXIS WORDS ON TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUSIVITY WILL BE WELCOMED IN INDIA THEY DONT ADDRESS NEW DELHIS MAIN CONCERN OVER THE BRI OF SOVEREIGNTY
Tamil-0037-9318	INDIAS OBJECTION TO THE CHINAPAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR CPEC IS THAT IT RUNS THROUGH PARTS OF PAKISTAN OCCUPIED KASHMIR AND THIS HAS LED TO THE MODI GOVERNMENTS DECISION TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SUMMIT
Tamil-0037-9319	INDIAS OTHER CONCERN OVER THE BRIS INROADS IN SOUTH ASIA WILL ALSO GROW AT THE SUMMIT CHINA LISTED THE CHINAMYANMAR ECONOMIC CORRIDOR AND THE NEPALCHINA TRANSHIMALAYAN MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONNECTIVITY NETWORK AND THE CPEC AS FOCUS AREAS
Tamil-0037-9320	EVEN SO INDIA HAS ABANDONED ITS SHARP RHETORIC AGAINST THE BRI THIS TIME COMPARED TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND CHINA ISSUED STATEMENTS SAYING IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DECISION TO AFFECT THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP
Tamil-0037-9321	THIS WAS AN INDICATOR THAT BOTH WOULD RATHER BE GUIDED ON THE ISSUE BY THE WUHAN SPIRIT THAN BY THE DEEP DIFFERENCES THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE OVER THE BRI PROJECT
Tamil-0037-9322	FORMER VICEPRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN HAS FINALLY ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY USPRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
Tamil-0037-9323	THOUGH THE TWENTIE TH CANDIDATE TO JOIN THE RACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET HE IS AMONG THE MOST PROMINENT  HE COMES WITH BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE AND HAS SUPPORT AMONG ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS
Tamil-0037-9324	HE HAS JOINED THE RACE AS A FRONTRUNNER WITH ONE POLL SEEING A SIXPOINT LEAD FOR HIM OVER HIS NEAREST RIVAL SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS OF VERMONT
Tamil-0037-9325	MRBIDEN ALSO BRINGS INTO FOCUS THE LEGACY OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
Tamil-0037-9326	VICEPRESIDENT IN THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE FOR EIGHT YEARS HE HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND AN ADVOCATE OF FREE COLLEGE
Tamil-0037-9327	BUT COMPARED TO HIS MAIN RIVALS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES SUCH AS SENATORS SANDERS AND ELIZABETH WARREN OF MASSACHUSETTS  ONE IS A SELFDECLARED DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST AND THE OTHER IS A SOCIAL DEMOCRAT  MRBIDEN IS MORE OF A CENTRIST THAN A LEFTIST INSURGENT
Tamil-0037-9328	HIS VIEWS ON HEALTH CARE BESIDES HIS SUPPORT FOR OBAMACARE ARE NOT VERY WELLKNOWN
Tamil-0037-9329	HE HAS NEITHER ENDORSED NOR DISAVOWED MEDICARE FOR ALL WHICH HAS EMERGED AS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN AMONG THE DEMOCRATS
Tamil-0037-9330	HE HAS NOT OFFERED ANY RADICAL ECONOMIC PROPOSAL EITHER SUCH AS SAY MSWARRENS DOLLAR TWO TRILLION EDUCATION PROPOSAL TO TACKLE COLLEGE COSTS AND STUDENT DEBT TRAPS OR MRSANDERSS REPEATED VOW TO TAKE WALL STREET TO TASK
Tamil-0037-9331	THE EASE WITH WHICH MRBIDEN RAISED DOLLAR SIX MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HIS ENTRY INTO THE RACE SUGGESTS THAT HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF BIG MONEY AS WELL
Tamil-0037-9332	BUT ALL THIS DOES NOT ENSURE THAT HIS PATH TO A CANDIDACY WOULD BE EASY
Tamil-0037-9333	MRBIDENS MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE WOULD BE HIS OWN RECORD AS A LEGISLATOR
Tamil-0037-9334	HE HAD LED THE EFFORTS TO PASS THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR CRIME BILL WHICH MANY LIBERALS AND PROGRESSIVES ATTACK FOR CONTRIBUTING TO MASS IMPRISONMENT ESPECIALLY OF AFRICANAMERICAN PEOPLE
Tamil-0037-9335	HE COSPONSORED THE CONTROVERSIAL ANTIDRUG ABUSE ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH LED TO MASS ARRESTS AND VOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE IRAQ INVASION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO
Tamil-0037-9336	HIS HARSH QUESTIONING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE OF ANITA HILL WHO HAD ACCUSED CLARENCE THOMAS NOW A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS COME INTO FOCUS RECENTLY
Tamil-0037-9337	BESIDES SEVERAL WOMEN HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST MRBIDEN IN RECENT MONTHS ALLEGING THAT HIS PHYSICAL CONDUCT MADE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
Tamil-0037-9338	HE HAS TRIED TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THIS PAST
Tamil-0037-9339	EARLIER THIS YEAR HE SAID HE WASNT ALWAYS RIGHT ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE HE REGRETTED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE ANTIDRUG ABUSE ACT HE HAS SPOKEN TO MSHILL IN PRIVATE AND VOWED TO BE MORE MINDFUL WITH WOMEN
Tamil-0037-9340	BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER MRBIDEN WITH THE BURDEN OF THIS RECORD AND HIS CENTRIST POLITICS WILL APPEAL TO THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT A TIME WHEN A WIDE VARIETY OF LEADERS FROM MRSANDERS TO CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASIOCORTEZ ARE PUSHING IT TO THE LEFT OF CENTRE
Tamil-0037-9341	THERE WAS A BLIND GIRL WHO HATED HERSELF PURELY FOR THE FACT SHE WAS BLIND 
Tamil-0037-9342	THE ONLY PERSON SHE DIDNT HATE WAS HER LOVING BOYFRIEND AS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER 
Tamil-0037-9343	SHE SAID THAT IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE THE WORLD SHE WOULD MARRY HIM
Tamil-0037-9344	ONE DAY SOMEONE DONATED A PAIR OF EYES TO HER  NOW SHE COULD SEE EVERYTHING INCLUDING HER BOYFRIEND 
Tamil-0037-9345	HER BOYFRIEND ASKED HER NOW THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WORLD WILL YOU MARRY ME
Tamil-0037-9346	THE GIRL WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE SAW THAT HER BOYFRIEND WAS BLIND TOO AND REFUSED TO MARRY HIM 
Tamil-0037-9347	HER BOYFRIEND WALKED AWAY IN TEARS AND LATER WROTE A LETTER TO HER SAYING
Tamil-0037-9348	JUST TAKE CARE OF MY EYES DEAR
Tamil-0037-9349	MORAL OF THE STORY WHEN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SO DOES OUR MIND 
Tamil-0037-9350	SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THEM 
Tamil-0037-9351	THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS STORY NOT JUST ONE
Tamil-0037-9352	THIS IS ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONAL SHORT STORIES THAT LEFT ME SPEECHLESS

Tamil-0038-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0038-9353	IT IS REASSURING THAT THERE WILL BE NO PARALLEL INQUIRIES INTO THE TWO SETS OF ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE ROCKED THE SUPREME COURT
Tamil-0038-9354	JUSTICE RETIRED AK
Tamil-0038-9355	PATNAIK WHO HAS BEEN TASKED WITH PROBING AN ALLEGED CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA HAS MADE THE RIGHT DECISION BY CHOOSING TO WAIT FOR THE END OF THE INHOUSE INQUIRY INTO A FORMER WOMAN EMPLOYEES COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY THE CJI AND SUBSEQUENT VICTIMISATION BEFORE STARTING HIS WORK
Tamil-0038-9356	THE COURT CONSTITUTED TWO INQUIRIES TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION FOLLOWING THE COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CJI
Tamil-0038-9357	A THREEJUDGE BENCH PASSING ORDERS ON A MATTER CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY APPOINTED JUSTICE PATNAIK TO INVESTIGATE THE AFFIDAVITS FILED BY UTSAV SINGH BAINS AN ADVOCATE WHO HAS ALLEGED A LARGER CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CJI INVOLVING DISGRUNTLED COURT EMPLOYEES AND OTHER FIXERS
Tamil-0038-9358	ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE AN INHOUSE COMMITTEE HEADED BY JUSTICE SA
Tamil-0038-9359	BOBDE WILL LOOK INTO THE COMPLAINT OF THE DISMISSED WOMAN COURT ASSISTANT
Tamil-0038-9360	THE BENCH EMPHASISED THAT THE PROBE INTO THE ALLEGED PLOT WOULD NOT IMPINGE ON THE HARASSMENT COMPLAINT
Tamil-0038-9361	HOWEVER IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SUCH PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER
Tamil-0038-9362	MRBAINS HAS ALLEGED HE WAS OFFERED UP TO RUPEES ONE CRORE BY SOMEONE TO FILE A FALSE COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CJI
Tamil-0038-9363	IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL NIGH IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY THE CLAIM WITHOUT EXAMINING IF THE INTERMEDIARIES HAD ANY NEXUS WITH THE COMPLAINANT
Tamil-0038-9364	CLEARLY THE COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SHOULD GET PRIORITY
Tamil-0038-9365	IT IS ONLY IF THE COMPLAINT IS FOUND TO BE FALSE THAT THERE WILL BE A CASE TO PROBE WHETHER IT WAS PART OF A PLOT TO MALIGN THE CJI OR A CONSPIRACY
Tamil-0038-9366	IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE INHOUSE COMMITTEE BECAME A CONTROVERSY
Tamil-0038-9367	THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE WOMAN MEMBER AND THE COMPLAINANT RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE PROXIMITY OF ONE OF ITS MEMBERS JUSTICE NV
Tamil-0038-9368	RAMANA WITH THE CJI
Tamil-0038-9369	HE HAS NOW RECUSED HIMSELF TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER WOMAN JUDGE
Tamil-0038-9370	THE EPISODE HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE LACUNA IN THE INHOUSE PROCEDURE THE JUDGES HAVE ADOPTED
Tamil-0038-9371	THERE IS NO PROVISION TO DEAL WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE CJI IS THE SUBJECT OF A COMPLAINT
Tamil-0038-9372	ALSO THE IDEA OF THE INQUIRY BEING WHOLLY INHOUSE IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WOMEN AT WORKPLACE PREVENTION PROHIBITION AND REDRESSAL ACT TWENTY THIRTEEN WHICH ENVISAGES THE PRESENCE OF AN EXTERNAL MEMBER
Tamil-0038-9373	DESPITE THIS SHORTCOMING THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TRY TO ENSURE A FAIR HEARING FOR THE FORMER EMPLOYEE
Tamil-0038-9374	THE DIGNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIARY WILL BE BETTER SERVED BY PROBING THE VERACITY OF HER CHARGE RATHER THAN BY PURSUING EVIDENCE FOR SWEEPING CLAIMS THAT THE RICH AND THE POWERFUL ARE TRYING TO RUN THE COURTS
Tamil-0038-9375	COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS IS A RELATIVELY LESS RECOGNISED COMPONENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Tamil-0038-9376	IN A SYSTEM THAT FOCUSSES MAINLY ON THE ACCUSED AN ORDER OF COMPENSATION IS A RECOGNITION OF THE STATES OBLIGATION TO VICTIMS OF CRIME ESPECIALLY HORRIFIC ACTS

Tamil-0038-9379	SIGNS LIKE THIS ALWAYS HAVE A WAY OF ATTRACTING YOUNG CHILDREN AND TO NO SURPRISE A BOY SAW THE SIGN AND APPROACHED THE OWNER 
Tamil-0038-9380	HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO SELL THE PUPPIES FOR HE ASKED
Tamil-0038-9381	THE STORE OWNER REPLIED ANYWHERE FROM 30 TO 50
Tamil-0038-9382	THE LITTLE BOY PULLED OUT SOME CHANGE FROM HIS POCKET I HAVE TWO DOLLARS HE SAID CAN I PLEASE LOOK AT THEM
Tamil-0038-9383	THE SHOP OWNER SMILED AND WHISTLED OUT OF THE KENNEL CAME LADY WHO RAN DOWN THE AISLE OF HIS SHOP FOLLOWED BY FIVE TEENY TINY BALLS OF FUR
Tamil-0038-9384	ONE PUPPY WAS LAGGING CONSIDERABLY BEHIND IMMEDIATELY THE LITTLE BOY SINGLED OUT THE LAGGING LIMPING PUPPY AND SAID WHATS WRONG WITH THAT LITTLE DOG
Tamil-0038-9385	THE SHOP OWNER EXPLAINED THAT THE VETERINARIAN HAD EXAMINED THE LITTLE PUPPY AND HAD DISCOVERED IT DIDNT HAVE A HIP SOCKET 
Tamil-0038-9386	IT WOULD ALWAYS LIMP IT WOULD ALWAYS BE LAME
Tamil-0038-9387	THE LITTLE BOY BECAME EXCITED THAT IS THE PUPPY THAT I WANT TO BUY
Tamil-0038-9388	THE SHOP OWNER SAID NO YOU DONT WANT TO BUY THAT LITTLE DOG IF YOU REALLY WANT HIM ILL JUST GIVE HIM TO YOU
Tamil-0038-9389	THE LITTLE BOY GOT QUITE UPSET HE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO THE STORE OWNERS EYES POINTING HIS FINGER AND SAID
Tamil-0038-9390	I DONT WANT YOU TO GIVE HIM TO ME THAT LITTLE DOG IS WORTH EVERY BIT AS MUCH AS ALL THE OTHER DOGS AND ILL PAY FULL PRICE IN FACT ILL GIVE YOU TWO DOLLARS NOW AND FIFTY CENTS A MONTH UNTIL I HAVE HIM PAID FOR
Tamil-0038-9391	THE SHOP OWNER COUNTERED YOU REALLY DONT WANT TO BUY THIS LITTLE DOG 
Tamil-0038-9392	HE IS NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN AND JUMP AND PLAY WITH YOU LIKE THE OTHER PUPPIES
Tamil-0038-9393	TO HIS SURPRISE THE LITTLE BOY REACHED DOWN AND ROLLED UP HIS PANT LEG TO REVEAL A BADLY TWISTED CRIPPLED LEFT LEG SUPPORTED BY A BIG METAL BRACE 
Tamil-0038-9394	HE LOOKED UP AT THE SHOP OWNER AND SOFTLY REPLIED WELL I DONT RUN SO WELL MYSELF AND THE LITTLE PUPPY WILL NEED SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS

Tamil-0039-9395	HANDING OVER THE FINE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE ACCUSED AS PART OF THEIR SENTENCE IS ONE ASPECT OF SUCH JUSTICE ANOTHER ASPECT IS FOR THE COURT TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIM FROM ITS OWN COFFERS
Tamil-0039-9396	A GROUP OF RIOTERS HAD RAPED HER AS WELL AS TWO OTHER WOMEN AND KILLED SEVEN MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY AT RANDHIKPUR VILLAGE ON MARCH THREE  TWO THOUSAND TWO
Tamil-0039-9397	THE COURT NOTED THAT SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF WITNESSING HER DAUGHTER BEING SMASHED AGAINST A WALL AS WELL AS THE DEVASTATION SUFFERED BY HER FAMILY
Tamil-0039-9398	SHE WAS ALSO PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT
Tamil-0039-9399	FURTHER THE COURT WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS LEADING AN ITINERANT HANDTOMOUTH EXISTENCE
Tamil-0039-9400	IT IS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE BENCH HEADED BY CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA RANJAN GOGOI AWARDED HER RUPEES FIFTY LAKH BESIDES ASKING THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE HER WITH A GOVERNMENT JOB AND A HOUSE
Tamil-0039-9401	MSBANOS CASE IS INDEED A RARE ONE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RESULTED IN CONVICTION AND LIFE SENTENCES TO ELEVEN PERSONS
Tamil-0039-9402	THE SENTENCES WERE UPHELD BY THE BOMBAY HIGH COURT
Tamil-0039-9403	FURTHER THE COURT FOUND DELIBERATE INACTION ON THE PART OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS AND THAT THE AUTOPSIES WERE PERFUNCTORY AND MANIPULATED
Tamil-0039-9404	THE SUPREME COURT HAS ASKED FOR THE PENSION BENEFITS OF THREE POLICE OFFICERS TO BE WITHDRAWN
Tamil-0039-9405	IN SHORT THIS IS A CONCRETE INSTANCE OF STATE INACTION AND NEGLIGENCE THAT WOULD NORMALLY JUSTIFY THE PAYMENT OF A HEFTY COMPENSATION
Tamil-0039-9406	NOT EVERY CRIME WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
Tamil-0039-9407	WHILE CONVICTIONS ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY IN CASES OF MOB VIOLENCE VICTIM COMPENSATION MAY OFTEN BE THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE SOME JUSTICE
Tamil-0039-9408	THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE WAS AMENDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO INSERT SECTION THREE FIFTY SEVEN A UNDER WHICH EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT HAS TO PREPARE A SCHEME TO SET UP A FUND FROM WHICH COMPENSATION CAN BE PAID TO VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THEIR DEPENDANTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED LOSS AND INJURY AND WHO MAY REQUIRE REHABILITATION
Tamil-0039-9409	THE CENTRE HAS A CENTRAL VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
Tamil-0039-9410	ON SUPREME COURT DIRECTIONS THE NATIONAL LEGAL SERVICES AUTHORITY HAS PREPARED A COMPENSATION SCHEME FOR WOMEN VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND OTHER CRIMES
Tamil-0039-9411	MANY STATES HAVE NOTIFIED SCHEMES ON THESE LINES
Tamil-0039-9412	WHILE ON PAPER THERE IS A MECHANISM TO ASSESS REHABILITATION NEEDS AND PAY COMPENSATION THERE IS A NEED TO STREAMLINE THE SCHEMES AND ENSURE THAT THE COMPENSATION PROCESS IS NOT DONE IN AN AD HOC MANNER BUT IS BASED ON SOUND PRINCIPLES
Tamil-0039-9413	WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT SUNDAYS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF IS THAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE SO PREDICTABLE

Tamil-0044-9572	THE HIGGS BOSON WAS DETECTED FIFTY YEARS AFTER IT HAD BEEN POSTULATED AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WERE OBSERVED A CENTURY AFTER EINSTEIN PREDICTED THEM
Tamil-0044-9573	VISUAL PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF BLACK HOLES COMES A CENTURY AFTER THEY APPEARED IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE
Tamil-0044-9574	IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT EIGHT TELESCOPES AROUND THE WORLD WERE USED FOR THE EXPERIMENT
Tamil-0044-9575	THE CHALLENGES INCLUDED MAKING EACH OBSERVE THE SAME BROAD RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS AROUND ONE MM AND HAVING PRECISE ATOMIC CLOCKS AT EACH LOCATION SO THE DATA COULD BE COMBINED
Tamil-0044-9576	A BLACK HOLE MARKS THE END OF SPACETIME AS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AND NOTHING THAT ENTERS IT CAN ESCAPE FROM THE TREMENDOUS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
Tamil-0044-9577	HOWEVER THIS IS NO REAL DANGER AS BLACK HOLES ARE LOCATED AT DISTANCES THAT HUMANS DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO SCALE
Tamil-0044-9578	THE EHT SET OUT TO IMAGE TWO CANDIDATE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES  SAGITTARIUS A WHICH IS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS FROM THE EARTH AT THE CENTRE OF THE MILKY WAY AND ANOTHER WHICH IS FIFTY FIVE MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY AT THE CENTRE OF THE MESSIER EIGHTY SEVEN GALAXY IN THE VIRGO GALAXY CLUSTER

Tamil-0044-9580	THE VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY TECHNIQUE LINKED RADIO DISHES OF TELESCOPES ACROSS THE WORLD TO PRODUCE A VIRTUAL TELESCOPE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH
Tamil-0044-9581	THIS WAS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE HIGH RESOLUTION REQUIRED FOR THIS MEASUREMENT
Tamil-0044-9582	COMBINING DATA FROM TELESCOPES EACH WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS WAS A SEPARATE CHALLENGE

Tamil-0054-9939	ALTHOUGH IF YOU EVER WANT TO GET ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT YOUD CALL SUCCESS IN LIFE THEN LAZINESS IS THE FIRST NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TO SORT OUT ABOVE ALL OTHERS 
Tamil-0054-9940	SUCCESS TAKES HARD WORK AND YOURE PROBABLY NOT THAT HARD WORKING IF YOU THINK YOURE LAZY
Tamil-0054-9941	WHY DO YOU THINK TWENTY PECENT OF ALL THE SELFDEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESS ARTICLES YOU READ ADDRESS LAZINESS
Tamil-0054-9942	BECAUSE ITS SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY NEED TO ADDRESS TOO
Tamil-0054-9943	IF YOU SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SELFDISCIPLINED YOURE BOUND TO BECOME MORE IMMUNE TO THE VARIOUS TEMPTATIONS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM STAYING ON TRACK

Tamil-0055-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0055-9949	THIS DECISION FOLLOWS VIOLENCE IN ITANAGAR WHICH INCLUDED ARSON ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCE OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF MINISTER
Tamil-0055-9950	THE GOVERNMENT TOOK THIS STEP TO DEESCALATE TENSIONS DESPITE THE FACT THAT BOTH MAINSTREAM PARTIES THE CONGRESS AND THE BJP WERE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THE DEMAND TO GRANT THE PRCS
Tamil-0055-9951	THE NONAPSTS INCLUDE THE DEORIS SONOWAL KACHARIS MORANS MISHINGS ADIVASIS AND EXSERVICEMEN BELONGING TO THE GORKHA COMMUNITY
Tamil-0055-9952	SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS AND MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE SAID PRCS ARE NEEDED TO AVAIL OF JOB AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND CURRENTLY THE TWENTY SIX TRIBES AND NUMEROUS SUBTRIBES WHO CLAIM TO BE NATIVE TO ARUNACHAL PRADESH ENJOY THIS PRIVILEGE
Tamil-0055-9953	MEMBERS OF SOME OF THE NONAPST COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LONGTIME RESIDENTS OF THE RECONSTITUTED STATE AND TO TERM THEM AS OUTSIDERS REFLECTS A CHAUVINISTIC MINDSET THAT DENIES A JUST DEMAND
Tamil-0055-9954	PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING ONE LED BY THE CONGRESS IN TWENTY TEN HAD ALSO BUCKLED UNDER PRESSURE ON THE ISSUE
Tamil-0055-9955	THE INDIGENOUS TRIBES OPPOSING THE MOVE SAY THIS IS ONE STEP AWAY FROM PROVIDING SCHEDULED TRIBE STATUS FOR THE NONAPSTS WHICH THEY VOCIFEROUSLY OPPOSE
Tamil-0055-9956	WHILE THIS FEAR IS OVERBLOWN THE AWARD OF PRCS COULD ENSURE LAND RIGHTS THAT ARE OTHERWISE DENIED TO THE NONAPSTS
Tamil-0055-9957	THE FACT THAT THE OPPOSITION TO THE DEMAND TOOK SUCH A VIOLENT TURN COULD BE LINKED TO A RETALIATION TO ATTEMPTS BY THE MEMBERS OF THE NONAPSTS TO ENFORCE AN ECONOMIC BLOCKADE OF THE STATE FROM THE NEIGHBOURING PARTS OF ASSAM LAST MONTH
Tamil-0055-9958	BUT THESE INCIDENTS SUGGEST THAT BARELY ANY NORTHEASTERN STATE IS TODAY FREE OF THE PATTERN OF ETHNIC DISCORD MARKED BY SOME COMMUNITIES BEING BRANDED OUTSIDERS AND SOUGHT TO BE DENIED RESIDENT PRIVILEGES
Tamil-0055-9959	THESE INCLUDE THE CHAKMA ISSUE IN MIZORAM THE HILL VERSUS VALLEY DISTURBANCES IN MANIPUR THE LONGSTANDING MIGRATION ISSUE IN ASSAM THE ATTACKS ON SIKH RESIDENTS IN MEGHALAYA AND EVEN THE CHAKMAHAJONG CITIZENSHIP ISSUE IN ARUNACHAL PRADESH ITSELF
Tamil-0055-9960	THE PATTERN THROUGH ALL THESE IS EERILY SIMILAR WITH ETHNIC IDENTITIES TRUMPING CIVIC CONSCIOUSNESS IN BRINGING ABOUT DISCORD THAT HAS EVEN ESCALATED INTO VIOLENCE IN SOME CASES
Tamil-0055-9961	ARUNACHAL PRADESH HAS OTHERWISE REMAINED A PEACEFUL STATE AND IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITY TO FOSTER A CIVIC CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ALLOWS EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS IN THE STATE
Tamil-0055-9962	THIS IS A DIFFICULT TASK AS IDENTITY ISSUES PERSIST AND FESTER WHEN THERE IS INADEQUATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  WHICH IS THE REAL BANE OF THE NORTHEAST TODAY
Tamil-0055-9963	THE ARREST OF ONE TWENTY NINE INDIANS ON THE CHARGE OF WILFULLY VIOLATING IMMIGRATION LAWS TO STAY AND WORK IN THE UNITED STATES SENDS A STARK MESSAGE TO YOUTH LOOKING FOR BETTER PROSPECTS ABROAD THEIR EFFORTS SHOULD BEGIN WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND STRICTLY FOLLOW THE LETTER OF THE LAW
Tamil-0055-9964	IN THE STING OPERATION CARRIED OUT BY THE USDEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHICH THREATENS TO ENCOMPASS MANY MORE INDIANS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF FARMINGTON CASE THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IS WHETHER THEY FELL VICTIM TO UNSCRUPULOUS RECRUITERS WHO OFFERED TO SECURE AN ITWENTY STUDENT DOCUMENT THAT ALLOWED THEM TO UNDERTAKE PAID WORK USING THE PROVISION FOR CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING OR KNOWINGLY ENGAGED IN FRAUD
Tamil-0055-9965	GOING BY THE INDICTMENT OF EIGHT RECRUITERS OF INDIAN ORIGIN THEY KNEW THEY WERE VIOLATING USIMMIGRATION LAW WHEN THEY ENROLLED STUDENTS USING FRAUDULENT AND UNLAWFUL MEANS AND THEIR PROFITS INCLUDED NEGOTIATED REFERRAL FEES PAID INTO THEIR ACCOUNTS BY UNDERCOVER AGENTS
Tamil-0055-9966	THE PROSECUTION HAS ALLEGED THAT EACH STUDENT WHO ENROLLED IN THE UNIVERSITY WAS AWARE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CLASSES CREDIT SCORES OR ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS AND THE INTENTION WAS MERELY TO PAY TO STAY AND GAIN ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT
Tamil-0055-9967	THESE STATEMENTS ARE OF COURSE SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY DURING THE TRIAL OF THE ALLEGED RECRUITERS
Tamil-0055-9968	THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS HAS MADE THE CORRECT DISTINCTION BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN DUPED AND THE RECRUITERS
Tamil-0055-9969	STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO PURSUE STUDIES AT AN AUTHORISED UNIVERSITY IN THE USSHOULD THEREFORE GET A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY AND NOT BE SUBJECTED TO SUMMARY DEPORTATION OR HUMILIATION
Tamil-0055-9970	IT MUST ALSO NOT PREJUDICE THE PROSPECTS OF SUCH STUDENTS WHO MAY APPLY IN FUTURE FOR LEGAL ENTRY
Tamil-0055-9971	THE UNIVERSITY OF FARMINGTON CASE IN MICHIGAN IS NOT THE FIRST INSTANCE OF INDIAN STUDENTS FALLING FOUL OF USIMMIGRATION LAWS ALTHOUGH IT STANDS APART AS A RACKET EXPOSED BY A STING OPERATION
Tamil-0055-9972	OTHERS SUCH AS TRIVALLEY UNIVERSITY AND HERGUAN UNIVERSITY WERE DEGREE MILLS RUN BY INDIVIDUALS THAT USED FALSE CLAIMS AND DOCUMENTS TO ENABLE YOUTH TO UNLAWFULLY STAY IN THE USAND IN MANY CASES PURSUE EMPLOYMENT
Tamil-0055-9973	THESE TRENDS REINFORCE THE NEED FOR GOOD COMMUNICATION THAT WOULD HELP STUDENTS IDENTIFY CREDENTIALED INSTITUTIONS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAM AND HIGHLIGHT THE SERIOUS NATURE OF VISA FRAUD

Tamil-0055-9978	INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING YOU THEYRE MORE LIKELY TO PUT YOUR DOWN
Tamil-0055-9979	AVOID PEOPLE WHO DONT RESPECT YOUR CHOICES OR CONSTANTLY EXPRESS SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR IDEAS 
Tamil-0055-9980	REAL FRIENDS WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU NO MATTER HOW CRAZY YOUR IDEA IS AND WILL ONLY WITHDRAW THEIR SUPPORT WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT YOU MIGHT DO YOURSELF HARM 
Tamil-0055-9981	A TOXIC FRIEND IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO YOUR SUCCESS
Tamil-0055-9982	A FRIEND WHO CONSTANTLY MAKES NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT YOUR GOALS AND DREAMS WILL ONLY DISTRACT YOUR FROM THEM

Tamil-0056-9987	IF THE AVERMENTS IN THE MICHIGAN CASE ARE CORRECT THE PROSPECT OF WORKING IN AMERICA ATTRACTED MANY OF THE SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO WERE RECRUITED
Tamil-0056-9988	THIS SHOULD SERVE AS A REMINDER TO INDIAS POLICYMAKERS THAT ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION JOBCREATION AND RAISING OF LIVING STANDARDS TO MEET THE ASPIRATIONS OF YOUTH MUST RECEIVE PRIORITY

Tamil-0056-9993	THEY COULD ALSO BE RELATED TO UNEASE ABOUT THE RECENTLY UNVEILED BACKSERIES DATA ON THE ECONOMY WHICH RECORDED SLOWER GROWTH DURING THE UPALED GOVERNMENTS RULE AND WERE RELEASED BY THE NITI AAYOG BYPASSING CONVENTION AND THE COMMISSIONS VIEWS
Tamil-0056-9994	REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE FINDINGS OF THE NEW PERIODIC LABOUR FORCE SURVEY FOR JULY TWENTY SEVENTEENDECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE NOT TOO FLATTERING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT REGISTERING A FIVEDECADE HIGH
Tamil-0056-9995	THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID NO SUCH RESERVATIONS WERE EXPRESSED BY MRMOHANAN OR DRMEENAKSHI DURING NSC MEETINGS AND THAT THE REPORT WILL BE RELEASED AFTER QUARTERLY DATA FOR THE SURVEY PERIOD IS PROCESSED
Tamil-0056-9996	A KEY ROLE OF THE NSC SET UP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IS TO VERIFY WHETHER DATA BEING PUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ARE RELIABLE AND ADEQUATE

Tamil-0058-0055	WHETHER SHE WILL TAKE HER MOTHERS PLACE IN RAE BARELI IS NOT CLEAR AS YET BUT THIS IS A SUGGESTION THAT THERE COULD BE A LONGTERM ROLE
Tamil-0058-0056	IN MANY WAYS THE NOMINATION IS AN ADMISSION OF THE PARTYS OVERRELIANCE ON THE FAMILY BUT TO THE CREDIT OF MRGANDHI HE HAS BEEN ENGAGING IN WIDER CONSULTATIONS WITHIN THE PARTY ON IMPORTANT DECISIONS
Tamil-0058-0057	THE CONGRESS IS STILL A CENTRALISED PARTY AND MRGANDHI IS ROUTINELY AUTHORISED TO TAKE THE FINAL CALL ON ALL MATTERS BIG AND SMALL BUT EQUALLY HE HAS ALSO SHOWN THE ABILITY TO STEP BACK IN A SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION IN DEALINGS WITH ALLIED PARTIES
Tamil-0058-0058	THAT HE DID NOT DECLARE HIMSELF AS A PRIME MINISTERIAL CANDIDATE OF THE OPPOSITION WAS BORN OF TACTICAL NECESSITY EVEN SO HE HAS SHOWN A FAIR AMOUNT OF MATURITY IN DEALING WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF ALLIES
Tamil-0058-0059	DURING THE MANMOHAN SINGH YEARS THE CONGRESS WAS ABLE TO COUNTER TO AN EXTENT AT LEAST THE PERCEPTION THAT IT REVOLVED AROUND THE DYNASTY
Tamil-0058-0060	AND THE BJP MAY NOT FIND MUCH POLITICAL PURCHASE IN LINKING MSVADRAS APPOINTMENT TO DYNASTIC POLITICS THERE WILL BE NO SURPRISE HOWEVER IF IT STARTS HARPING ON HER HUSBANDS ALLEGEDLY MURKY LAND DEALINGS WHICH HAD CROPPED UP DURING THE TWENTY FOURTEEN ELECTION CAMPAIGN
Tamil-0058-0061	WHAT SHOULD ENGAGE THE CONGRESS IS NOT WHAT THE BJP MAY SAY ABOUT MSVADRA BUT WHAT SHE CAN SAY AND DO FOR IT
Tamil-0058-0062	THE PARTY NEEDS MUCH MORE THAN A STAR CAMPAIGNER IT NEEDS LEADERS THAT CAN REVITALISE THE ORGANISATION BY PRESENTING IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE BJP
Tamil-0058-0063	FOR THAT IT WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A TRULY INCLUSIVE EGALITARIAN VISION THAT PRIVILEGES ALLROUND DEVELOPMENT ABOVE ALL ELSE
Tamil-0058-0064	THE LATEST ASSESSMENT OF HOW CHILDREN ARE FARING IN SCHOOLS IN RURAL AREAS INDICATES THERE HAS BEEN NO DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN LEARNING OUTCOMES
Tamil-0058-0065	THE PICTURE THAT EMERGES FROM THE ANNUAL STATUS OF EDUCATION REPORT RURAL TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS ONE OF A MORIBUND SYSTEM OF EARLY SCHOOLING IN MANY STATES WITH NO REMARKABLE PROGRESS FROM THE BASE YEAR OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT
Tamil-0058-0066	EXCEPT FOR A SMALL SECTION AT THE TOP OF THE CLASS THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN LET DOWN
Tamil-0058-0067	THE SURVEY FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAD A REACH OF FIVE LAKH STUDENTS IN FIVE NINETY SIX RURAL DISTRICTS
Tamil-0058-0068	IT SHOULD PUT ADMINISTRATORS ON ALERT THAT WHILE FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF STUDENTS IN CLASS FIVE IN RURAL GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS COULD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT READ A TEXT MEANT FOR CLASS TWO  THE CORRESPONDING FIGURE FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN STOOD AT FOURTY FOUR PERCENT FOR COMPARISON PRIVATE SCHOOLS SCORED SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT AND SIXTY FIVE PERCENT FOR THE SAME TEST IN THOSE YEARS
Tamil-0058-0069	ARITHMETIC ABILITY SHOWED A SIMILAR TREND OF UNDERPERFORMANCE ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT UPTICK SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN AN IMPROVEMENT OF ABOUT ONE PERCENTAGE POINTS IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AND TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AMONG CLASS FIVE STUDENTS

Tamil-0058-0071	A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WERE NOT EVEN ABLE TO RECOGNISE LETTERS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CLASS HIGHLIGHTING A SEVERE BARRIER TO LEARNING
Tamil-0058-0072	NOW THAT THE ASER MEASURE IS AVAILABLE FOR TEN YEARS THE CENTRE SHOULD INSTITUTE A REVIEW MECHANISM INVOLVING ALL STATES FOR BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS COVERING ELEMENTARY EDUCATION AND MIDDLE SCHOOL
Tamil-0058-0073	A PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ACTIVITYBASED LEARNING OUTCOMES DEFICITS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND INNOVATIONS IN BETTER PERFORMING STATES CAN HELP
Tamil-0058-0074	AT PRESENT CHILDREN START LEARNING IN A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS FROM POORLY EQUIPPED ANGANWADI CENTRES TO PRIVATE NURSERIES
Tamil-0058-0075	THE ENACTMENT OF THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION ACT WAS FOLLOWED BY A WELCOME RISE IN ENROLMENT WHICH NOW TOUCHES NINETY SIX PERCENT AS PER ASER DATA
Tamil-0058-0076	EMPOWERING AS IT IS THE LAW NEEDS A SUPPORTIVE FRAMEWORK TO CATER TO LEARNERS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WHO OFTEN CANNOT RELY ON PARENTAL SUPPORT OR COACHING
Tamil-0058-0077	THERE IS CONCERN THAT CURRICULAR EXPECTATIONS ON LITERACY AND NUMERACY HAVE BECOME TOO AMBITIOUS REQUIRING REFORM
Tamil-0058-0078	IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT INNOVATION IN SCHOOLS AND INCENTIVISING GOOD OUTCOMES ONE STUDY IN ANDHRA PRADESH INDICATED THAT BONUS PAY OFFERED TO TEACHERS LED TO BETTER STUDENT SCORES IN AN INDEPENDENTLY ADMINISTERED TEST IN MATHEMATICS AND LANGUAGE
Tamil-0058-0079	THE SOLUTIONS MAY LIE IN MULTIPLE APPROACHES

Tamil-0058-0081	HAVING SOMEONE AROUND WHO IS GENUINELY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOURE DOING IS QUITE AMAZING

Tamil-0058-0085	FRIENDS CAN INSPIRE YOU TO WORK HARDER TOWARDS ACHIEVING YOUR GOAL OR MAKE SURE THAT YOURE STICKING TO YOUR RESOLUTIONS

Tamil-0064-9331	THE EASE WITH WHICH MRBIDEN RAISED DOLLAR SIX MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HIS ENTRY INTO THE RACE SUGGESTS THAT HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF BIG MONEY AS WELL
Tamil-0064-9332	BUT ALL THIS DOES NOT ENSURE THAT HIS PATH TO A CANDIDACY WOULD BE EASY
Tamil-0064-9333	MRBIDENS MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE WOULD BE HIS OWN RECORD AS A LEGISLATOR
Tamil-0064-9334	HE HAD LED THE EFFORTS TO PASS THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR CRIME BILL WHICH MANY LIBERALS AND PROGRESSIVES ATTACK FOR CONTRIBUTING TO MASS IMPRISONMENT ESPECIALLY OF AFRICANAMERICAN PEOPLE
Tamil-0064-9335	HE COSPONSORED THE CONTROVERSIAL ANTIDRUG ABUSE ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH LED TO MASS ARRESTS AND VOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE IRAQ INVASION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO
Tamil-0064-9336	HIS HARSH QUESTIONING IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE OF ANITA HILL WHO HAD ACCUSED CLARENCE THOMAS NOW A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS COME INTO FOCUS RECENTLY
Tamil-0064-9337	BESIDES SEVERAL WOMEN HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST MRBIDEN IN RECENT MONTHS ALLEGING THAT HIS PHYSICAL CONDUCT MADE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
Tamil-0064-9338	HE HAS TRIED TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THIS PAST
Tamil-0064-9339	EARLIER THIS YEAR HE SAID HE WASNT ALWAYS RIGHT ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE HE REGRETTED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE ANTIDRUG ABUSE ACT HE HAS SPOKEN TO MSHILL IN PRIVATE AND VOWED TO BE MORE MINDFUL WITH WOMEN
Tamil-0064-9340	BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER MRBIDEN WITH THE BURDEN OF THIS RECORD AND HIS CENTRIST POLITICS WILL APPEAL TO THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT A TIME WHEN A WIDE VARIETY OF LEADERS FROM MRSANDERS TO CONGRESSWOMAN ALEXANDRIA OCASIOCORTEZ ARE PUSHING IT TO THE LEFT OF CENTRE
Tamil-0064-9341	THERE WAS A BLIND GIRL WHO HATED HERSELF PURELY FOR THE FACT SHE WAS BLIND 
Tamil-0064-9342	THE ONLY PERSON SHE DIDNT HATE WAS HER LOVING BOYFRIEND AS HE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER 
Tamil-0064-9343	SHE SAID THAT IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE THE WORLD SHE WOULD MARRY HIM
Tamil-0064-9344	ONE DAY SOMEONE DONATED A PAIR OF EYES TO HER  NOW SHE COULD SEE EVERYTHING INCLUDING HER BOYFRIEND 
Tamil-0064-9345	HER BOYFRIEND ASKED HER NOW THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WORLD WILL YOU MARRY ME
Tamil-0064-9346	THE GIRL WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE SAW THAT HER BOYFRIEND WAS BLIND TOO AND REFUSED TO MARRY HIM 
Tamil-0064-9347	HER BOYFRIEND WALKED AWAY IN TEARS AND LATER WROTE A LETTER TO HER SAYING
Tamil-0064-9348	JUST TAKE CARE OF MY EYES DEAR
Tamil-0064-9349	MORAL OF THE STORY WHEN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SO DOES OUR MIND 
Tamil-0064-9350	SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE WAY THINGS WERE BEFORE AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THEM 
Tamil-0064-9351	THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS STORY NOT JUST ONE
Tamil-0064-9352	THIS IS ONE OF THE INSPIRATIONAL SHORT STORIES THAT LEFT ME SPEECHLESS

Tamil-0065-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0065-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0065-9571	ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE BLACK HOLE MADE ITS WAY INTO PHYSICS THROUGH ALBERT EINSTEINS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY SOON AFTER THE LIGO COLLABORATION FIRST DIRECTLY OBSERVED THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES MADE BY THE MERGING OF TWO BLACK HOLES THE DARK STAR HAD FINALLY BEEN IMAGED
Tamil-0065-9572	THE HIGGS BOSON WAS DETECTED FIFTY YEARS AFTER IT HAD BEEN POSTULATED AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WERE OBSERVED A CENTURY AFTER EINSTEIN PREDICTED THEM
Tamil-0065-9573	VISUAL PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF BLACK HOLES COMES A CENTURY AFTER THEY APPEARED IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE
Tamil-0065-9574	IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT EIGHT TELESCOPES AROUND THE WORLD WERE USED FOR THE EXPERIMENT
Tamil-0065-9575	THE CHALLENGES INCLUDED MAKING EACH OBSERVE THE SAME BROAD RANGE OF WAVELENGTHS AROUND ONE MM AND HAVING PRECISE ATOMIC CLOCKS AT EACH LOCATION SO THE DATA COULD BE COMBINED
Tamil-0065-9576	A BLACK HOLE MARKS THE END OF SPACETIME AS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AND NOTHING THAT ENTERS IT CAN ESCAPE FROM THE TREMENDOUS GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
Tamil-0065-9577	HOWEVER THIS IS NO REAL DANGER AS BLACK HOLES ARE LOCATED AT DISTANCES THAT HUMANS DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO SCALE
Tamil-0065-9578	THE EHT SET OUT TO IMAGE TWO CANDIDATE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES  SAGITTARIUS A WHICH IS TWENTY SIX THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS FROM THE EARTH AT THE CENTRE OF THE MILKY WAY AND ANOTHER WHICH IS FIFTY FIVE MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY AT THE CENTRE OF THE MESSIER EIGHTY SEVEN GALAXY IN THE VIRGO GALAXY CLUSTER
Tamil-0065-9579	BUT THE FIRST IMAGE WAS OF THE MORE DISTANT ONE
Tamil-0065-9580	THE VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY TECHNIQUE LINKED RADIO DISHES OF TELESCOPES ACROSS THE WORLD TO PRODUCE A VIRTUAL TELESCOPE THE SIZE OF THE EARTH
Tamil-0065-9581	THIS WAS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE HIGH RESOLUTION REQUIRED FOR THIS MEASUREMENT
Tamil-0065-9582	COMBINING DATA FROM TELESCOPES EACH WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS WAS A SEPARATE CHALLENGE
Tamil-0065-9583	CUTTINGEDGE DEVELOPMENTS FROM COMPUTER SCIENCE RELATED TO IMAGE RECOGNITION WERE USED
Tamil-0065-9584	AS KATIE BOUMAN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY WHO LED THE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM TO PUT THE DATA TOGETHER AND CREATE THE IMAGE SAID IN A TEDX TALK PROJECTS SUCH AS THE EHT SUCCEED OWING TO INTERDISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE THAT PEOPLE BRING TO THE TABLE
Tamil-0065-9585	THIS EXPERIMENT ENDORSES THE DIVERSITY OF COLLABORATION JUST AS MUCH AS IT DOES UNRELENTING PATIENCE AND GOOD FAITH IN THE POWER OF SCIENCE AND REASON
Tamil-0065-9586	A FORECAST OF A BELOW AVERAGE MONSOON IN TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER LAST YEARS ERRATIC RAINFALL THAT FLOODED KERALA AND CRIPPLED AGRICULTURE IN EASTERN AND WESTERN STATES IS A CAUSE FOR WORRY
Tamil-0065-9587	IF THE ASSESSMENT FROM ONE AGENCY SKYMET IS ANY INDICATION THERE IS A PROSPECT OF AN EL NIO OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH DROUGHT CONDITIONS TAKING HOLD
Tamil-0065-9588	THIS MUST OF COURSE BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT SEEM TO WEAKEN THE EL NIO LINK SUCH AS A DIPOLE WEATHER PHENOMENON IN THE INDIAN OCEAN
Tamil-0065-9589	SHOULD THE MONSOON WHICH NORMALLY SETS IN BETWEEN JUNE ONE AND JULY FIFTEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TURN OUT TO BE DEFICIENT IT WILL ADD TO THE PRESSURES ON RURAL EMPLOYMENT AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE
Tamil-0065-9590	THINGS MAY BECOME CLEARER WHEN THE INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT ALSO ISSUES ITS FORECAST ALTHOUGH ERROR MARGINS AND THE ERRATIC NATURE OF RAINFALL IN DIFFERENT REGIONS RENDER THE EXERCISE FRAUGHT WITH UNCERTAINTY
Tamil-0065-9591	LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE THE REALISATION OF RAINFALL WAS NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE LONGTERM AVERAGE WHILE THE PREDICTION WAS FOR NINETY SEVEN PERCENT
Tamil-0065-9592	MORE IMMEDIATELY INDIA WILL GO TO THE POLLS IN THE PEAK OF SUMMER AFTER AN INTENSIVE CAMPAIGN
Tamil-0065-9593	IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE ADMINISTRATIONS TO PREPARE FOR THE LIKELIHOOD OF A HEAT SPIKE PARTICULARLY DURING APRIL AND MAY TO PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE AND EXTREME DISTRESS TO COMMUNITIES
Tamil-0065-9594	OFFICIAL AGENCIES AND NGOS SHOULD START ADOPTING THE DRILL ON THIS USING THE TEMPLATE DRAWN UP BY THE NATIONAL DISASTER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
Tamil-0065-9595	THE KEY ELEMENTS OF PROTECTION IN A HEAT WAVE ARE AVOIDING EXPOSURE DURING THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY AROUND NOON ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF SENIOR CITIZENS STAYING ADEQUATELY HYDRATED WEARING SUITABLE CLOTHING INCLUDING HEADGEAR AND CREATING SHADE IN PUBLIC PLACES

Telugu-0001-0034	I SELECT THIS STARTINGPOINT BECAUSE THE DISTINCTIONOR WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE SUCH BETWEEN THEM IS ONE WITH WHICH WE ARE SO FAMILIAR THAT I CAN SAFELY ASSUME ITS RECOGNITION BY EVERYBODY 
Telugu-0001-0035	AND I MAY THEREFORE AT ONCE STATE THIS DISTINCTION BY USING THE ADJECTIVES WHICH WE HABITUALLY APPLY AS EXPRESSING THE NATURAL OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE TWO LIVING SPIRIT AND DEAD MATTER

Telugu-0008-0322	DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INCORPORATED IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND ONE QUARTER 
Telugu-0008-0323	A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED 
Telugu-0008-0324	THE GOVERNMENT IS EXPECTED TO SELL ABOUT TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW NOTES AND BONDS STARTING TOMORROW 
Telugu-0008-0325	THE QUESTION THEN ARISES HOW CAN THE HEALER SUBSTITUTE HIS OWN CONSCIOUS MIND FOR THAT OF THE PATIENT AND THE ANSWER SHOWS THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THOSE VERY ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES WHICH I HAVE LAID DOWN IN THE EARLIER SECTIONS 
Telugu-0008-0326	OUR ORDINARY CONCEPTION OF OURSELVES IS THAT OF AN INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY WHICH ENDS WHERE ANOTHER PERSONALITY BEGINS IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE TWO PERSONALITIES ARE ENTIRELY SEPARATE 
Telugu-0008-0327	THIS IS AN ERROR 
Telugu-0008-0328	THERE IS NO SUCH HARD AND FAST LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN PERSONALITIES AND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER CAN BE INCREASED OR REDUCED IN RIGIDITY ACCORDING TO WILL 
Telugu-0008-0329	IN FACT THEY MAY BE TEMPORARILY REMOVED SO COMPLETELY THAT FOR THE TIME BEING THE TWO PERSONALITIES BECOME MERGED INTO ONE 
Telugu-0008-0330	NOW THE ACTION WHICH TAKES PLACE BETWEEN HEALER AND PATIENT DEPENDS ON THIS PRINCIPLE 
Telugu-0008-0331	THE PATIENT IS ASKED BY THE HEALER TO PUT HIMSELF IN A RECEPTIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS TO EXERCISE HIS VOLITION FOR THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING THE BARRIER OF HIS OWN OBJECTIVE PERSONALITY AND THUS AFFORDING ENTRANCE TO THE MENTAL POWER OF THE HEALER 
Telugu-0008-0332	ON HIS SIDE ALSO THE HEALER DOES THE SAME THING ONLY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHILE THE PATIENT WITHDRAWS THE BARRIER ON HIS SIDE WITH THE INTENTION OF ADMITTING A FLOWINGIN 
Telugu-0008-0333	THE HEALER DOES SO WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING A FLOWINGOUT AND THUS BY THE JOINT ACTION OF THE TWO MINDS THE BARRIERS OF BOTH PERSONALITIES ARE REMOVED AND THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOW OF VOLITION IS DETERMINED 
Telugu-0008-0334	THAT IS TO SAY IT FLOWS FROM THE HEALER AS ACTIVELY WILLING TO GIVE TOWARDS THE PATIENT AS PASSIVELY WILLING TO RECEIVE ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF NATURE THAT THE FLOW MUST ALWAYS BE FROM THE PLENUM TO THE VACUUM 
Telugu-0008-0335	THIS MUTUAL REMOVAL OF THE EXTERNAL MENTAL BARRIER BETWEEN HEALER AND PATIENT IS WHAT IS TERMED ESTABLISHING A RAPPORT BETWEEN THEM 
Telugu-0008-0336	AND HERE WE FIND ONE MOST VALUABLE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE LAID DOWN EARLIER IN THIS BOOKTHAT PURE SPIRIT IS PRESENT IN ITS ENTIRETY AT EVERY POINT SIMULTANEOUSLY 
Telugu-0008-0337	IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT AS SOON AS THE HEALER REALIZES THAT THE BARRIERS OF EXTERNAL PERSONALITY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS PATIENT HAVE BEEN REMOVED 
Telugu-0008-0338	HE CAN THEN SPEAK TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OF THE PATIENT AS THOUGH IT WERE HIS OWN FOR BOTH BEING PURE SPIRIT THE THOUGHT OF THEIR IDENTITY MAKES THEM IDENTICAL 
Telugu-0008-0339	AND BOTH ARE CONCENTRATED INTO A SINGLE ENTITY AT A SINGLE POINT UPON WHICH THE CONSCIOUS MIND OF THE HEALER CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF THE CONTROL OF THE SUBJECTIVE MIND BY THE OBJECTIVE MIND THROUGH SUGGESTION 
Telugu-0008-0340	IT IS FOR THIS REASON I HAVE INSISTED ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PURE SPIRIT OR SPIRIT CONCEIVED OF APART FROM EXTENSION IN ANY MATRIX AND THE CONCEPTION OF IT AS SO EXTENDED
Telugu-0008-0341	IF WE CONCENTRATE OUR MIND UPON THE DISEASED CONDITION OF THE PATIENT WE ARE THINKING OF HIM AS A SEPARATE PERSONALITY AND ARE NOT FIXING OUR MIND UPON THAT CONCEPTION OF HIM AS PURE SPIRIT WHICH WILL AFFORD US EFFECTUAL ENTRY TO HIS SPRINGS OF BEING 
Telugu-0008-0342	WE MUST THEREFORE WITHDRAW OUR THOUGHT FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF SYMPTOMS AND INDEED FROM HIS CORPOREAL PERSONALITY ALTOGETHER AND MUST THINK OF HIM AS A PURELY SPIRITUAL INDIVIDUALITY 
Telugu-0008-0343	AND AS SUCH ENTIRELY FREE FROM SUBJECTION TO ANY CONDITIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY AS VOLUNTARILY EXTERNALIZING THE CONDITIONS MOST EXPRESSIVE OF THE VITALITY AND INTELLIGENCE WHICH PURE SPIRIT IS 
Telugu-0008-0344	THINKING OF HIM THUS WE THEN MAKE MENTAL AFFIRMATION THAT HE SHALL BUILD UP OUTWARDLY THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THAT PERFECT VITALITY WHICH HE KNOWS HIMSELF TO BE INWARDLY

Telugu-0054-2294	I DO NOT WISH TO DESCRIBE THE PICNIC PARTY ON THE TOP OF THE TOWER 
Telugu-0054-2295	YOU CAN IMAGINE WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT IS LIKE TO CARVE A CHICKEN AND A TONGUE WITH A KNIFE THAT HAS ONLY ONE BLADE  AND THAT SNAPPED OFF SHORT ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN 
Telugu-0054-2296	BUT IT WAS DONE 
Telugu-0054-2297	EATING WITH YOUR FINGERS IS GREASY AND DIFFICULT  AND PAPER DISHES SOON GET TO LOOK VERY SPOTTY AND HORRID 
Telugu-0054-2298	BUT ONE THING YOU CANT IMAGINE AND THAT IS HOW SODAWATER BEHAVES WHEN YOU TRY TO DRINK IT STRAIGHT OUT OF A SYPHON  ESPECIALLY A QUITE FULL ONE 
Telugu-0054-2299	BUT IF IMAGINATION WILL NOT HELP YOU EXPERIENCE WILL AND YOU CAN EASILY TRY IT FOR YOURSELF IF YOU CAN GET A GROWNUP TO GIVE YOU THE SYPHON 
Telugu-0054-2300	IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A REALLY THOROUGH EXPERIENCE PUT THE TUBE IN YOUR MOUTH AND PRESS THE HANDLE VERY SUDDENLY AND VERY HARD 
Telugu-0054-2301	YOU HAD BETTER DO IT WHEN YOU ARE ALONE  AND OUT OF DOORS IS BEST FOR THIS EXPERIMENT

Telugu-0054-2307	THEN EAT A GREAT DEAL MORE DINNER THAN USUAL AND SIT IN THE HOT SUN ON THE TOP OF A CHURCHTOWER  OR EVEN ANYWHERE ELSE  YOU BECOME SOON AND STRANGELY SLEEPY 
Telugu-0054-2308	NOW ANTHEA AND JANE AND CYRIL AND ROBERT WERE VERY LIKE YOU IN MANY WAYS AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN ALL THEY COULD AND DRUNK ALL THERE WAS THEY BECAME SLEEPY STRANGELY AND SOON  ESPECIALLY ANTHEA BECAUSE SHE HAD GOT UP SO EARLY
