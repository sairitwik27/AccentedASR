Kannada-0002-2400	AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS THE TOTAL RAINFALL HAS MET THE CRITERIA FOR NORMALITY 
Kannada-0002-2401	ALTHOUGH THERE ARE WIDE VARIATIONS IN THE PATTERNS OF SHOWERS LEAVING SOME DISTRICTS HIT BY DROUGHT AS OTHERS FACE FLOODS

Kannada-0002-2404	ARUNACHAL PRADESH GUJARAT TELANGANA AND VIDARBHA EXPERIENCED DEFICITS RANGING FROM TWENTY PERCENT TO SIXTY PERCENT
Kannada-0002-2405	IN THE CASE OF GUJARAT IT HAS BEEN A STORY OF BOTH DEFICIENCY AND HEAVY RAINFALL WITHIN THE STATE 
Kannada-0002-2406	AS WITH MANY PREVIOUS MONSOONS THIS RAINY SEASON HAS SO FAR WITNESSED A LOT OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
Kannada-0002-2407	AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE DIED THIS YEAR

Kannada-0002-2411	THE RAINFALL PATTERNS WITH THEIR SPATIAL VARIATIONS HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURE AND GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AS WELL
Kannada-0002-2412	WATER IS THE KEY DETERMINANT OF INDIAS AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT AND THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FARMERS CHAIRED BY THE SCIENTIST
Kannada-0002-2413	PROFESSOR SWAMINATHAN HAD SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ITS OPTIMAL USE 
Kannada-0002-2414	GIVEN THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF THE ONE HUNDRE MILLION HECTARES OF GROSS SOWN AREA ASSESSED BY THE COMMISSION WAS FOUND TO BE RAINFED AN ACCELERATED PROGRAMME TO HARNESS THE MONSOON IS VITAL 
Kannada-0002-2415	THE REVENUE LARGE AS IT WAS WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF FORMER KINGS BARELY SUFFICED TO MEET THIS NEW CHARGE 
Kannada-0002-2416	A GREAT PART OF THE PRODUCE OF THE NEW TAXES WAS ABSORBED BY THE NAVAL EXPENDITURE 
Kannada-0002-2417	AT THE CLOSE OF THE LATE REIGN THE WHOLE COST OF THE ARMY THE TANGIER REGIMENTS INCLUDED HAD BEEN UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR 
Kannada-0002-2418	SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WOULD NOT NOW SUFFICE 
Kannada-0002-2419	IF ANY FURTHER AUGMENTATION WERE MADE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DEMAND A SUPPLY FROM PARLIAMENT
Kannada-0002-2420	AND IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT PARLIAMENT WOULD BE IN A COMPLYING MOOD 
Kannada-0002-2421	THE VERY NAME OF STANDING ARMY WAS HATEFUL TO THE WHOLE NATION 
Kannada-0002-2422	AND TO NO PART OF THE NATION MORE HATEFUL THAN TO THE CAVALIER GENTLEMEN WHO FILLED THE LOWER HOUSE 
Kannada-0002-2423	IN THEIR MINDS A STANDING ARMY WAS INSEPARABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUMP WITH THE PROTECTOR
Kannada-0002-2424	WITH THE SPOLIATION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE PURGATION OF THE UNIVERSITIES
Kannada-0002-2425	WITH THE ABOLITION OF THE PEERAGE WITH THE MURDER OF THE KING

Kannada-0002-2430	IT WAS THEREFORE PROBABLE THAT THE KING WOULD FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF HIS ARMY THAN EVEN TO OBTAIN THE REPEAL OF THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT

Kannada-0005-2512	NOT ONLY DO THESE VAGUE DEFINITIONS GIVE UNCHECKED POWER TO THE POLICE TO HARASS CITIZENS BUT THEY ALSO REVEAL THE PREJUDICES UNDERLYING THE LAW 
Kannada-0005-2513	THE POINTED REFERENCE TO SINGING DANCING FORTUNE TELLING PERFORMING OR OFFERING ANY ARTICLE FOR SALE MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ACT IS NOT SIMPLY TO CRIMINALISE THE ACT OF BEGGING
Kannada-0005-2514	BUT TO TARGET GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES WHOSE ITINERANT PATTERNS OF LIFE DO NOT FIT WITHIN MAINSTREAM STEREOTYPES OF THE SEDENTARY LAWABIDING CITIZEN WITH A SETTLED JOB 
Kannada-0005-2515	AND THE REFERENCE TO NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND WANDERING ABOUT PUNISHES PEOPLE FOR THE CRIME OF LOOKING POOR
Kannada-0005-2516	BUT IT ALSO REFLECTS THE LAWMAKERS DESIRE TO ERASE FROM PUBLIC SPACES PEOPLE WHO LOOK OR ACT DIFFERENTLY AND WHOSE PRESENCE IS PERCEIVED TO BE A BOTHER AND A NUISANCE 
Kannada-0005-2517	THE BEGGING ACT ENCODES INTO LAW THE VICIOUS PREJUDICE THAT RECENTLY SAW A PROMINENT INSTITUTION PUTTING UP SPIKES OUTSIDE ITS MUMBAI BRANCH TO DETER ROUGH SLEEPING
Kannada-0005-2518	ONCE INDIVIDUALS FALL WITHIN ITS CLUTCHES THE BEGGING ACT EFFECTIVELY RENDERS THEM INVISIBLE BY CONFINING THEM TO CERTIFIED INSTITUTIONS AFTER A TRUNCATED SUMMARY JUDICIAL PROCEDURE
Kannada-0005-2519	LIKE THE POORHOUSES OF 19TH CENTURY EUROPE IT IS BASED ON A PHILOSOPHY OF FIRST CRIMINALISING POVERTY AND THEN MAKING IT INVISIBLE BY PHYSICALLY REMOVING OFFENDERS FROM PUBLIC SPACES
Kannada-0005-2520	EFFECTIVELY IT PLACES A CORDON SANITAIRE AROUND THE POOR AND THE UNDESIRABLE KEEPING THEM FROM ACCESSING SPACES RESERVED FOR THE USE OF RESPECTABLE CITIZENS 
Kannada-0005-2521	FOR THESE PEOPLE THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF PLURALISM AND INCLUSIVENESS DO NOT EXIST
Kannada-0005-2522	THE AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT HESITATED TO USE THE BEGGING ACT AS A WEAPON 
Kannada-0005-2523	JUST BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN COMMONWEALTH GAMES THE DELHI GOVERNMENT WAS ENGAGED IN COMBING OPERATIONS TO TAKE BEGGARS OFF THE STREET 
Kannada-0005-2524	LEST THEIR PRESENCE EMBARRASS THE NATION IN THE EYES OF FOREIGNERS 
Kannada-0005-2525	SUCH OPERATIONS ARE ALSO A REGULAR PART OF PREPARING FOR NATIONAL EVENTS SUCH AS INDEPENDENCE DAY AND REPUBLIC DAY
Kannada-0005-2526	IN ITS JUDGMENT DELIVERED LAST WEEK  A BENCH OF THE DELHI HIGH COURT PRESIDED OVER BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE HELD THAT THE BEGGING ACT VIOLATED ARTICLE FOURTEEN AND ARTICLE TWENTY ONE OF THE CONSTITUTION 
Kannada-0005-2527	IN ORAL ARGUMENT THE GOVERNMENT CONCEDED THAT IT DID NOT INTEND TO CRIMINALISE INVOLUNTARY BEGGING 
Kannada-0005-2528	THE HIGH COURT NOTED HOWEVER THAT THE DEFINITION OF BEGGING UNDER THE ACT MADE NO SUCH DISTINCTION AND WAS THEREFORE ENTIRELY ARBITRARY 
Kannada-0005-2529	MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ALSO HELD THAT UNDER ARTICLE TWENTY ONE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT WAS THE STATES RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE BASIC NECESSITIES FOR SURVIVAL FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER TO ALL ITS CITIZENS 
Kannada-0005-2530	POVERTY WAS THE RESULT OF THE STATES INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS TO DISCHARGE THESE OBLIGATIONS 
Kannada-0005-2531	THEREFORE THE STATE COULD NOT TURN AROUND AND CRIMINALISE THE MOST VISIBLE AND PUBLIC MANIFESTATION OF ITS OWN FAILURES
Kannada-0005-2532	AND INDEED PENALISE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING NOTHING MORE THAN COMMUNICATING THE REALITY OF THEIR SITUATION TO THE PUBLIC
Kannada-0005-2533	THE DELHI HIGH COURTS JUDGMENT MARKS A CRUCIAL STEP FORWARD IN DISMANTLING ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS AND ENDURING LEGACIES OF COLONIALISM 
Kannada-0005-2534	IT IS PERHAPS FITTING THAT THIS JUDGMENT COMES JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IS LIKELY TO VINDICATE NAZ FOUNDATION AFTER A TENYEAR LEGAL BATTLE 
Kannada-0005-2535	BOTH NAZ FOUNDATION AND HARSH MANDER RECOGNISE THAT OUR CONSTITUTION IS A TRANSFORMATIVE CONSTITUTION 
Kannada-0005-2536	THE INTERVAL WAS WELL EMPLOYED BY THOSE WHO TOOK THE LEAD AGAINST THE COURT 
Kannada-0005-2537	THEY HAD INDEED NO LIGHT WORK TO PERFORM IN THREE DAYS A COUNTRY PARTY WAS TO BE ORGANIZED 
Kannada-0005-2538	THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK IS IN OUR AGE NOT EASILY TO BE APPRECIATED

Kannada-0005-2540	WHAT IS SAID BY THE LEADERS OF THE MINISTRY AND OF THE OPPOSITION AFTER MIDNIGHT IS READ BY THE WHOLE METROPOLIS AT DAWN 
Kannada-0005-2541	BY THE INHABITANTS OF NORTHLAND AND CORNWALL IN THE AFTERNOON AND IN IRELAND AND THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND ON THE MORROW
Kannada-0005-2542	IN OUR AGE THEREFORE THE STAGES OF LEGISLATION THE RULES OF DEBATE THE TACTICS OF FACTION THE OPINIONS

Kannada-0005-2544	EVERY MAN WHO NOW ENTERS PARLIAMENT POSSESSES WHAT IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A GREAT STOCK OF PARLIAMENTARY KNOWLEDGE 
Kannada-0005-2545	SUCH KNOWLEDGE WAS THEN TO BE OBTAINED ONLY BY ACTUAL PARLIAMENTARY SERVICE 
Kannada-0005-2546	THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN OLD AND A NEW MEMBER WAS AS GREAT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A VETERAN SOLDIER AND A RECRUIT JUST TAKEN FROM THE PLOUGH 
Kannada-0005-2547	AND JAMESS PARLIAMENT CONTAINED A MOST UNUSUAL PROPORTION OF NEW MEMBERS 
Kannada-0005-2548	WHO HAD BROUGHT FROM THEIR COUNTRY SEATS TO WESTMINSTER NO POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE AND MANY VIOLENT PREJUDICES 
Kannada-0005-2549	THESE GENTLEMEN HATED THE PAPISTS BUT HATED THE WHIGS NOT LESS INTENSELY AND REGARDED THE KING WITH SUPERSTITIOUS VENERATION 
Kannada-0005-2550	TO FORM AN OPPOSITION OUT OF SUCH MATERIALS WAS A FEAT WHICH REQUIRED THE MOST SKILFUL AND DELICATE MANAGEMENT

Kannada-0006-2553	THAT CRIMINALISE STATUS WILL ALSO BE CALLED INTO QUESTION 
Kannada-0006-2554	NONETHELESS IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER ONE THING A COURT CAN STRIKE DOWN AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW BUT IT CANNOT REFORM SOCIETY 
Kannada-0006-2555	POVERTY AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE RECOGNISED IN HER JUDGMENT IS A SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEM 
Kannada-0006-2556	THE DELHI HIGH COURT HAS DONE ITS JOB IN STRIKING DOWN A VICIOUS LAW THAT CRIMINALISED POVERTY
Kannada-0006-2557	BUT IT IS THE TASK OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNMENT TO REPLACE THE PUNITIVE STRUCTURE OF THE NOW DEFUNCT BEGGING ACT
Kannada-0006-2558	WITH A NEW SET OF MEASURES THAT GENUINELY FOCUSSES ON THE REHABILITATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND MARGINALISED MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY

Kannada-0006-2560	BRING A RAY OF HOPE TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS LIVING IN THE COUNTRYS NORTH AND EAST 
Kannada-0006-2561	AFTER THE TALKS LAST WEEK LEADERS OF THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC COUNCIL THE POLITICAL WING OF THE KURDISHLED SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES SAID THEY WERE READY TO WORK WITH THE REGIME
Kannada-0006-2562	TOWARDS CREATING A DEMOCRATIC DECENTRALISED SYRIA WITH A NEW SYSTEM AND A NEW FORM 
Kannada-0006-2563	THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR THAT A DELEGATION WAS SENT BY KURDISH REBELS TO DAMASCUS 
Kannada-0006-2564	DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR BOTH SIDES HAVE MORE OR LESS REFRAINED FROM TARGETING EACH OTHER 
Kannada-0006-2565	WHILE THE ASSAD REGIME WITHDREW TROOPS FROM THE KURDISH AREAS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE CIVIL WAR TO DEFEND ITS COASTAL STRONGHOLD AGAINST THE REBELS
Kannada-0006-2566	KURDISH FIGHTERS CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION TO ESTABLISH AUTONOMOUS RULE 
Kannada-0006-2567	WHEN THE ISLAMIC STATE MOVED TO KURDISH TOWNS IN TWO THOUSANDS FIFTEEN THE REBELS WITH HELP FROM THE US SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED THEM 
Kannada-0006-2568	NOW THEY CONTROL ALMOST A THIRD OF SYRIA THE LARGEST CHUNK OF TERRITORIES OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT RULE 
Kannada-0006-2569	THE TALKS ALSO TOOK PLACE AFTER THE REGIME RECAPTURED DERAA IN THE SOUTH THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SYRIAN REBELLION

Kannada-0006-2573	DAMASCUSS STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE TO SEIZE THE ENTIRE SOUTH AND THEN MOVE NORTH 
Kannada-0006-2574	BEFORE ATTACKING IDLIB THE LAST STRONGHOLD OF ANTIREGIME REBELS THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO ENGAGE THE KURDS AND KURDISH MILITIAS
Kannada-0006-2575	THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THEY ARE NOT SEEKING INDEPENDENCE FROM SYRIA AND ONLY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR AUTONOMY 
Kannada-0006-2576	THE FOREIGN EMBASSIES WERE ALL IN A FERMENT
Kannada-0006-2577	IT WAS WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT A FEW DAYS WOULD NOW DECIDE THE GREAT QUESTION WHETHER THE KING OF ENGLAND WAS OR WAS NOT TO BE THE VASSAL OF THE KING OF FRANCE 
Kannada-0006-2578	THE MINISTERS OF THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA WERE MOST ANXIOUS THAT JAMES SHOULD GIVE SATISFACTION TO HIS PARLIAMENT 
Kannada-0006-2579	INNOCENT HAD SENT TO LONDON TWO PERSONS CHARGED TO INCULCATE MODERATION BOTH BY ADMONITION AND BY EXAMPLE 
Kannada-0006-2580	ONE OF THEM WAS JOHN LEYBURN AN ENGLISH DOMINICAN WHO HAD BEEN SECRETARY TO CARDINAL HOWARD

Kannada-0006-2586	NO NUNCIO HAD BEEN RECEIVED HERE DURING THE HUNDRED AND TWENTYSEVEN YEARS WHICH HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE DEATH OF MARY 
Kannada-0006-2587	LEYBURN WAS LODGED IN WHITEHALL AND RECEIVED A PENSION OF A THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR 
Kannada-0006-2588	ADDA DID NOT YET ASSUME A PUBLIC CHARACTER
Kannada-0006-2589	HE PASSED FOR A FOREIGNER OF RANK WHOM CURIOSITY HAD BROUGHT TO LONDON APPEARED DAILY AT COURT AND WAS TREATED WITH HIGH CONSIDERATION 
Kannada-0006-2590	BOTH THE PAPAL EMISSARIES DID THEIR BEST TO DIMINISH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE ODIUM INSEPARABLE FROM THE OFFICES WHICH THEY FILLED AND TO RESTRAIN THE RASH ZEAL OF JAMES

Kannada-0010-2714	WITH THE PPP STILL IN DISARRAY THE STARS WERE ALIGNED FOR MR KHAN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THIS PERCEPTION HAS CATAPULTED HIS PARTY FROM TWENTY EIGHT SEATS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN IN A HOUSE OF TWO SEVENTY TWO 
Kannada-0010-2715	NO DOUBT HE WAS HELPED BY THE KHALAI MAKHLOOQ EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS WHO ENGINEERED LASTMINUTE DEFECTIONS FROM THE PMLN BUT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE HAWA THAT HAS ENSURED HIS VICTORY
Kannada-0010-2716	THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELECTION HAS CONTRIBUTED A NEW TERM ELECTABLES TO PAKISTANI ELECTION TERMINOLOGY
Kannada-0010-2717	IN THEIR CONSTITUENCIES LARGELY RURAL AND SEMIURBAN CONSTITUENCIES IN PUNJAB BECAUSE OF FAMILY TIES AND FINANCIAL STANDING AND HAVE BUILT AN EFFICIENT PATRONAGE SYSTEM
Kannada-0010-2718	IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THEY HAD ABANDONED THE PML AND SWITCHED TO THE PML RETURNING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT 
Kannada-0010-2719	THIS TIME MANY JOINED THE PTI WHILE SOME CHOSE TO FIGHT AS INDEPENDENTS RATHER THAN UNDER THE PMLN BANNER 
Kannada-0010-2720	THE REASON WAS THAT THE PTI WAS WIDELY SEEN TO BE THE KINGS PARTY THIS TIME WITH MR KHAN BEING DESCRIBED IN PUNJAB AS THE NEW LAADLA
Kannada-0010-2721	CONTRARY TO MOST EXPECTATIONS THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES HAVE NOT FARED WELL IN TERMS OF WINNING SEATS

Kannada-0010-2727	THE MQMS HOLD HAS BEEN IN THE URBAN AREAS OF SINDH WHICH ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY FOUR OUT OF SIXTY ONE SEATS IN THE PROVINCE 
Kannada-0010-2728	FACTIONALISM A LEADERSHIP VACUUM WITH THE OLD GUARD IN EXILE AND ARMY OPERATIONS TO BREAK ITS NEXUS WITH ORGANISED RACKETEERING BROUGHT DOWN THE MQM FROM NINETEEN TO MERELY SIX SEATS THIS TIME

Kannada-0010-2732	HIS ELECTION VICTORY SHOWS THAT HE REMAINS AN ICON FOR THE BELOW THIRTY FIVE VOTER REFLECTING THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF PAKISTAN BUT CHARISMA CAN FADE QUICKLY TOO
Kannada-0010-2733	IN HIS POLITICS MR KHAN HAS BEEN ERRATIC VOWING TO FIGHT CORRUPTION SEEKING TO EMBRACE THE TALIBAN 
Kannada-0010-2734	ADOPTING A NATIONALIST ANTIUS STANCE CRITICISING THE ARMY FOR ITS DEALINGS WITH THE US WHILE STAYING ON ITS RIGHT SIDE CULTIVATING A PIOUS IMAGE TOGETHER WITH A PERSONAL LIFESTYLE THAT IS IN SHARP CONTRAST 
Kannada-0010-2735	GIVEN THAT THE SENATE WILL REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE PML AND THE PPP AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS HE WILL FACE DIFFICULTIES IN TERMS OF HIS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA

Kannada-0010-2740	HE WAS ALWAYS HEARD BY THE HOUSE WITH RESPECT 
Kannada-0010-2741	FOR HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW CLERGYMEN WHO COULD IN THAT AGE BOAST OF NOBLE BLOOD 
Kannada-0010-2742	HIS OWN LOYALTY AND THE LOYALTY OF HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN SIGNALLY PROVED

Kannada-0010-2747	SOME FLASHES OF HIS MILITARY SPIRIT WOULD TO THE LAST OCCASIONALLY BREAK FORTH 
Kannada-0010-2748	HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION OF THE TWO PRINCESSES 
Kannada-0010-2749	AND HAD ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF THAT IMPORTANT DUTY IN A MANNER WHICH HAD SATISFIED ALL GOOD PROTESTANTS 
Kannada-0010-2750	AND HAD SECURED TO HIM CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF HIS PUPILS ESPECIALLY OF THE LADY ANNE

Kannada-0011-2753	MR KHAN MAY WELL FIND THAT THIS TIME AROUND HE IS CAPTAIN BUT ONLY IN NAME
Kannada-0011-2754	LAST YEAR DURING A VISIT TO MYANMAR BRITAINS THEN FOREIGN SECRETARY BORIS JOHNSON VISITED THE SHWEDAGON PAYA 
Kannada-0011-2755	ONE OF BUDDHISMS MOST SACRED SITES ADOPTING THE USUAL FREESTYLE SOMEWHAT AWKWARD BUMBLING TONE HE HAD BECOME KNOWN FOR 
Kannada-0011-2756	THE INVOCATION OF THE COLONIALERA POEM CLEARLY CAUGHT THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR OFF GUARD HE WAS CAPTURED ON CAMERA 
Kannada-0011-2757	FIRMLY STOPPING MR JOHNSON FROM PROCEEDING FURTHER WITH THE RECITAL SAYING IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA AND NOT APPROPRIATE 
Kannada-0011-2758	WHILE THE REMARK DID INDEED PROVOKE CRITICISM AT HOME AND BEYOND IT WAS DISMISSED BY MANY AS YET ANOTHER BORIS GAFFE ONE OF MANY THAT HE HAS CLOCKED UP OVER HIS POLITICAL CAREER
Kannada-0011-2759	MR JOHNSONS TIME AS FOREIGN SECRETARY WAS PEPPERED WITH CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS INCLUDING HIS REMARKS ON BOOSTING THE WHISKY TRADE BETWEEN INDIA AND THE UK DURING A VISIT TO A BRITISH GURDWARA 
Kannada-0011-2760	THERE WAS A JOKE ABOUT BOOSTING BRITISH INVESTMENT INTO LIBYA 
Kannada-0011-2761	THEY HAVE GOT A BRILLIANT VISION TO TURN SIRTE WITH THE HELP OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF SIRTE INTO THE NEXT DUBAI THE ONLY THING THEYVE GOT TO DO IS CLEAR THE DEAD BODIES HE SAID IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN 
Kannada-0011-2762	AND THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING A VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND WHERE HE COMPARED THE TRADITIONAL MAORI GREETING TO A HEAD BUTT THAT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED IN A PUB IN GLASGOW
Kannada-0011-2763	IT MIGHT BE EASY TO DISMISS SOME OF THESE BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT HAD TO BE SEEN IN A MORE SERIOUS LIGHT SUCH AS HIS MISCHARACTERISATION OF NAZANIN
Kannada-0011-2764	HIS COMMENTS PROVOKED AN OUTCRY AT THE TIME GOING AGAINST HER INSISTENCE SHE HAD SIMPLY BEEN ON HOLIDAY AND WERE SEEN AS WORSENING HER ALREADY ABYSMAL PLIGHT IN THE COUNTRY 
Kannada-0011-2765	MR JOHNSONS TYPICAL RESPONSE TO THESE CONTROVERSIES HAS BEEN TO OFFER A NONAPOLOGY
Kannada-0011-2766	HIS EARLY BLUNDERS DURING HIS TIME AS MAYOR OF LONDON SERVED TO STRENGTHEN HIS IMAGE PARTICULARLY BEYOND BRITAINS SHORES 
Kannada-0011-2767	HIS LATER ONES WERE THE SUBJECT OF MORE SERIOUS SCRUTINY INCLUDING QUESTIONS AROUND HIS APPROPRIATENESS AS THE HEAD OF BRITAINS FOREIGN OFFICE 
Kannada-0011-2768	AT A TIME WHEN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD OUTSIDE EUROPE MATTER MORE THAN EVER BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BY AND LARGE TREATED AS BLUNDERS 
Kannada-0011-2769	EVEN AT THE TIME THIS WAS A RATHER NAIVE ASSUMPTION GIVEN MR JOHNSONS BACKGROUND OXFORDEDUCATED HE ONCE EDITED THE CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE THE SPECTATOR 
Kannada-0011-2770	AND SAVVILY SENSED THE DIRECTION OF BRITISH POLITICS BY FINALLY LEAPING INTO THE BREXIT CAMP AFTER HE HAD DRAFTED TWO COLUMNS EACH TAKING A DIFFERENT POSITION ON BREXIT
Kannada-0011-2771	MR JOHNSONS LATEST COMMENTS ON THE BURKA CHALLENGE SUGGEST A MUCH MORE METHODOLOGICAL DELIBERATE APPROACH 
Kannada-0011-2772	IN THE FACE OF A PUBLIC OUTCRY INCLUDING CRITICISM FROM PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY AND CALLS FOR THE PARTY WHIP TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM HE HAS STOOD FIRMLY BY HIS COMMENTS IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH EARLIER THIS WEEK 
Kannada-0011-2773	HE DESCRIBED THE BURKA AS OPPRESSIVE AND RIDICULOUS AND COMPARED WOMEN WHO WORE THEM TO LETTER BOXES 
Kannada-0011-2774	SUBSEQUENTLY HE HAS LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE VIEWED THE CALLS FOR AN APOLOGY AS RIDICULOUS CITING IT AS PART OF HIS EFFORT TO SPEAK UP FOR LIBERAL VALUES 
Kannada-0011-2775	IT IS NOT THE ONLY TIME HE HAS CAUSED SUCH OFFENCE BEFORE HE BECAME LONDON MAYOR HE ONCE USED A RACIST SLUR TO REFER TO THE PEOPLE THE QUEEN WOULD MEET ON HER TRIPS ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH
Kannada-0011-2776	THE LATEST COMMENTS COME AT A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE RULING CONSERVATIVE PARTY ALREADY SUFFERING FROM GREAT IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN ITS RANKS PARTICULARLY ON BREXIT AND THE IMMIGRATION POLICY 
Kannada-0011-2777	WHILE THE LABOUR PARTY HAS FACED CRITICISM OVER ITS TREATMENT OF ANTISEMITISM WITHIN ITS RANKS THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF TOLERATING ISLAMOPHOBIA WITHIN THEIRS 
Kannada-0011-2778	IT WAS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT EITHER GERARD OR HAMPDEN TO DEATH 
Kannada-0011-2779	GREY HAD STIPULATED FOR THEIR LIVES BEFORE HE CONSENTED TO BECOME A WITNESS AGAINST THEM
Kannada-0011-2780	BUT THERE WAS A STILL STRONGER REASON FOR SPARING THEM 
Kannada-0011-2781	THEY WERE HEIRS TO LARGE PROPERTY BUT THEIR FATHERS WERE STILL LIVING 
Kannada-0011-2782	THE COURT COULD THEREFORE GET LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORFEITURE AND MIGHT GET MUCH IN THE WAY OF RANSOM 
Kannada-0011-2783	GERARD WAS TRIED AND FROM THE VERY SCANTY ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US SEEMS TO HAVE DEFENDED HIMSELF WITH GREAT SPIRIT AND FORCE 
Kannada-0011-2784	HE BOASTED OF THE EXERTIONS AND SACRIFICES MADE BY HIS FAMILY IN THE CAUSE OF CHARLES THE FIRST AND PROVED RUMSEY 
Kannada-0011-2785	THE WITNESS WHO HAD MURDERED RUSSELL BY TELLING ONE STORY AND CORNISH BY TELLING ANOTHER TO BE UTTERLY UNDESERVING OF CREDIT 
Kannada-0011-2786	THE JURY WITH SOME HESITATION FOUND A VERDICT OF GUILTY 
Kannada-0011-2787	AFTER LONG IMPRISONMENT GERARD WAS SUFFERED TO REDEEM HIMSELF 
Kannada-0011-2788	HAMPDEN HAD INHERITED THE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND A LARGE SHARE OF THE ABILITIES OF HIS GRANDFATHER 
Kannada-0011-2789	BUT HAD DEGENERATED FROM THE UPRIGHTNESS AND THE COURAGE BY WHICH HIS GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN DISTINGUISHED 
Kannada-0011-2790	IT APPEARS THAT THE PRISONER WAS WITH CRUEL CUNNING LONG KEPT IN AN AGONY OF SUSPENSE
Kannada-0011-2791	IN ORDER THAT HIS FAMILY MIGHT BE INDUCED TO PAY LARGELY FOR MERCY

Kannada-0012-2795	THE LEADER OF THE HINDU SAMHATI LAST YEAR TO HIGHLIGHT A WIDER PROBLEM OF ISLAMOPHOBIA WITHIN PARTY THE ROOM HAD BEEN BOOKED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF A CONSERVATIVE MP 
Kannada-0012-2796	MR JOHNSONS LATEST COMMENTS HAVE PROVOKED ANGER FROM BOTH MUSLIM AND NONMUSLIM MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WITH ONE SENIOR MP DOMINIC GRIEVE SUGGESTING HE WOULD LEAVE THE PARTY SHOULD THE FORMER BECOME ITS LEADER 
Kannada-0012-2797	FOR ITS PART THE PARTY SAID IT HAD LAUNCHED A DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATION INTO MR JOHNSONS COMMENTS ON THE BURKA
Kannada-0012-2798	HOWEVER HE HAS HAD MANY DEFENDERS TOO A RECENT POLL FOR SKY NEWS FOUND THAT UP TO SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PUBLIC DID NOT VIEW HIS COMMENTS AS RACIST AND CONSERVATIVES IN BOTH BRITAIN AND THE US HAVE DEFENDED HIM 
Kannada-0012-2799	IN FACT WHEN MR TRUMP BECAME US PRESIDENT MR JOHNSONS CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE WAS AMONG THE MOST EFFUSIVE OF SENIOR POLITICIANS GLOBALLY 
Kannada-0012-2800	I AM INCREASINGLY ADMIRING OF DONALD TRUMP MR JOHNSON REMARKED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHILE MR TRUMP IN TURN SUGGESTED THAT MR JOHNSON WOULD MAKE A GREAT PRIME MINISTER
Kannada-0012-2801	MR JOHNSONS PRIME MINISTERIAL ASPIRATIONS ARE OF COURSE NO SECRET 
Kannada-0012-2802	DURING HIS TIME AS FOREIGN SECRETARY UNTIL HIS RESIGNATION IN EARLY JULY IN PROTEST AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENTS BREXIT POLICY MANY OF HIS ACTIONS WERE SEEN AS ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE MS MAY 
Kannada-0012-2803	SUCH AS PUBLISHING A FOUR THOUSAND WORD ESSAY ON HIS VISION OF BREXIT JUST BEFORE A MAJOR SPEECH BY HER 
Kannada-0012-2804	HE IS SEEN AS A FRONTRUNNER TO REPLACE HER IN EARLY AUGUST JUST BEFORE HIS COMMENTS ON THE BURKA BUT AFTER HIS RESIGNATION 
Kannada-0012-2805	HE CAME IN AS THE MOST POPULAR PERSON TO REPLACE MS MAY IN A POLL BY CONSERVATIVE HOME SUGGESTING HIS INCREASINGLY RIGHTWARD POLITICS WAS STRIKING A CHORD WITH THE PARTY MEMBERSHIP 
Kannada-0012-2806	HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN HIS PARTY TO HAVE BENEFITED FROM ITS INTERNALISATION OF INCREASINGLY RIGHTWING POLICIES AS HAS BEEN SEEN WITH THE RISE OF JACOB REESMOGG 
Kannada-0012-2807	THE CHAIR OF THE ANTIBREXIT EUROPEAN RESEARCH GROUP WHOSE PARTICULARLY CONSERVATIVE VEIN OF CONSERVATISM HAS MADE HIM THE UNLIKELY FIGUREHEAD OF A YOUNG RIGHTWING PARTY MOVEMENT
Kannada-0012-2808	IT WOULD HARDLY COME AS A SURPRISE THAT STEVE BANNON THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE ALTRIGHT BART NEWS AND FORMER ADVISER TO MR TRUMP 
Kannada-0012-2809	HAS ADMITTED TO BEING IN REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS WITH MR JOHNSON MR BANNON HAS SPOKEN OF HIS EAGERNESS TO BUILD AN ANTIEUROPEAN UNION 
Kannada-0012-2810	NATIONALIST MOVEMENT ACROSS EUROPE AND HAS DESCRIBED THE BRITISH POLITICIAN AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSONS ON THE WORLD STAGE 
Kannada-0012-2811	MR JOHNSONS LATEST COMMENTS AND THE OUTCRY AGAINST HIM WILL ONLY SERVE TO STRENGTHEN HIS APPEAL TO THE RIGHT
Kannada-0012-2812	WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MR JOHNSON WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY REMAINS TO BE SEEN DISCIPLINARY ACTION COULD VERY WELL FOLLOW 
Kannada-0012-2813	WHICH WOULD HELP BUILD HIS IMAGE AS A MARTYR OF THE ALTRIGHT 
Kannada-0012-2814	ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH HIS POLITICAL DAYS ARE FAR FROM OVER AS THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK OF PANDERING TO PREJUDICE AND DIVISION GAINS ADMIRERS IN EUROPE
Kannada-0012-2815	IMRAN KHANS PAKISTAN TEHREEKEINSAF HAS EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS IN EMERGING FROM WEDNESDAYS ELECTION WITHIN TOUCHING DISTANCE OF A MAJORITY 
Kannada-0012-2816	THE FORMER CRICKETER WILL COME TO THE PRIME MINISTERS OFFICE AT THE END OF A BITTER YEAR AND HIS FIRST TEST WILL BE TO ASSERT A LEGITIMATE CLAIM TO POWER 
Kannada-0012-2817	THE CAMPAIGN FOR THESE FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL ELECTIONS IN PAKISTAN HAS BEEN CALLED THE DIRTIEST IN ITS HISTORY 
Kannada-0012-2818	AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULTS IS ALREADY TAINTED BY ALLEGATIONS OF RIGGING AND MILITARY INTERFERENCE 
Kannada-0012-2819	BUT DISGRACED THE ILLUSTRIOUS NAME WHICH HE BORE BY ABJECT SUBMISSIONS AND ENTREATIES 
Kannada-0012-2820	HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN PRIVY TO THE DESIGN OF ASSASSINATION 
Kannada-0012-2821	BUT HE OWNED THAT HE HAD MEDITATED REBELLIONPROFESSED DEEP REPENTANCE FOR HIS OFFENCE
Kannada-0012-2822	IMPLORED THE INTERCESSION OF THE JUDGES AND VOWED THAT IF THE ROYAL CLEMENCY WERE EXTENDED TO HIM 
Kannada-0012-2823	HIS WHOLE LIFE SHOULD BE PASSED IN EVINCING HIS GRATITUDE FOR SUCH GOODNESS 
Kannada-0012-2824	THE WHIGS WERE FURIOUS AT HIS PUSILLANIMITY AND LOUDLY DECLARED HIM TO BE FAR MORE DESERVING OF BLAME THAN GREY

Kannada-0012-2828	THE UNHAPPY MAN HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO FEEL KEENLY THE DEGRADATION TO WHICH HE HAD STOOPED 
Kannada-0012-2829	HE SURVIVED THE DAY OF HIS IGNOMINY SEVERAL YEARS 
Kannada-0012-2830	HE LIVED TO SEE HIS PARTY TRIUMPHANT TO BE ONCE MORE AN IMPORTANT MEMBER OF IT 
Kannada-0012-2831	TO RISE HIGH IN THE STATE AND TO MAKE HIS PERSECUTORS TREMBLE IN THEIR TURN 
Kannada-0012-2832	BUT HIS PROSPERITY WAS EMBITTERED BY ONE INSUPPORTABLE RECOLLECTION

Kannada-0013-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0013-2834	IN FACT THE REMOVAL OF NAWAZ SHARIF AS PRIME MINISTER LAST SUMMER AND LATER FROM THE ELECTORAL ARENA OVER A CONVICTION ON CORRUPTION CHARGES HAD GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DICE WERE LOADED IN MR KHANS FAVOUR 
Kannada-0013-2835	THE FORMER CRICKETER WILL BE WATCHED FOR HOW HE EMERGES FROM THE SHADOW OF THE CAMPAIGN AND THE ELECTION ITSELF 
Kannada-0013-2836	HIS IMMEDIATE TASK IS TO NEGOTIATE ASSISTANCE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO STAVE OFF A BALANCE OF PAYMENTS CRISIS 
Kannada-0013-2837	PAKISTAN HAS ALREADY SOUGHT MORE LOANS FROM CHINA WITH NO SIGN THAT THE COSTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS UNDER THE CHINAPAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR WILL BE RECOVERED SOON
Kannada-0013-2838	HIS NEXT SET OF CHALLENGES EMERGE FROM THE REGION WHERE HE WILL BE EXPECTED TO MAKE GOOD ON PROMISES MADE BY PAKISTAN TO WASHINGTON AND KABUL TO CRACK DOWN ON TERROR AND BRING THE TALIBAN TO THE TABLE FOR TALKS 
Kannada-0013-2839	MR KHAN HAS LONG HELD THAT THE US MUST FIRST PULL OUT TROOPS FROM AFGHANISTAN AND WAS CALLED TALIBAN KHAN FOR SUGGESTING THAT TALIBAN MILITANTS WERE FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE
Kannada-0013-2840	THE NEXT STEPS WILL TAKE PLACE AMID GREAT SCRUTINY OF THE TENOR OF HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH DONALD TRUMPS ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE US PRESIDENTS TOUGH TALK AGAINST PAKISTAN
Kannada-0013-2841	MR KHAN WILL ALSO HAVE TO TACKLE TERROR GROUPS INSIDE PAKISTAN THOSE THAT TARGET PAKISTANI FORCES AND THOSE TRAINED WITH PAKISTANS SUPPORT TO TARGET ITS NEIGHBOURS 
Kannada-0013-2842	IT IS HERE THAT PRIME MINISTER KHAN WILL BE MOST TESTED THESE GROUPS FUNCTION WITH IMPUNITY
Kannada-0013-2843	AND IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER HIS SOFTNESS DURING THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THEM WILL CARRY OVER INTO THE PRIME MINISTERSHIP
Kannada-0013-2844	SIGNIFICANTLY HE SPENT THE MOST TIME ON TIES WITH INDIA WHEN LISTING HIS FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES 
Kannada-0013-2845	WHILE HIS COMMENTS ON ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN JAMMU AND KASHMIR WILL NOT BE VIEWED KINDLY IN NEW DELHI THOSE ON RESOLVING DISPUTES THROUGH DIALOGUE MUST BE REGARDED SERIOUSLY 
Kannada-0013-2846	SO FAR HE HAD DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM WHAT HE CALLED THE SOFT APPROACH OF THE SHARIF GOVERNMENT TOWARDS INDIA 
Kannada-0013-2847	BUT AFTER THE ELECTION RESULT MR KHAN CLAIMED THAT NO PAKISTANI LEADER HAD ENGAGED MORE WITH INDIA THAN HE HAD 
Kannada-0013-2848	HE OFFERED TO TAKE TWO STEPS FORWARD IF INDIA RECIPROCATES 
Kannada-0013-2849	FOR THE MOMENT HE WILL ALSO BE AWARE OF OTHER ODDS THAT ARE STACKED AGAINST HIM NOT THE LEAST BEING THAT OF BECOMING THE FIRST PAKISTANI PM TO COMPLETE A FULL TERM
Kannada-0013-2850	FOOTBALL IS ALWAYS ABOUT MORE THAN FOOTBALL 
Kannada-0013-2851	THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE DURING A WORLD CUP WHEN A STAGED FACEOFF BETWEEN NATIONAL TEAMS CONCENTRATES ON STEREOTYPES AND ENFLAMES POLITICAL TENSIONS
Kannada-0013-2852	WHO CAN FORGET WHEN THE US WAS BEATEN BY IRAN IN THE FINAL MINUTES OF THEIR GROUPSTAGE ENCOUNTER IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
Kannada-0013-2853	OR WHEN THE REIGNING WORLD CHAMPIONS FRANCE WERE DEFEATED BY SENEGAL A FORMER FRENCH COLONY IN THEIR FIRST MATCH OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWO TOURNAMENT
Kannada-0013-2854	OR WHEN LUIS SUAREZS HANDBALL STOPPED GHANA FROM BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN TEAM TO REACH A SEMIFINAL IN THE ONLY WORLD CUP EVER TO BE HELD ON AFRICAN SOIL IN TWO THOUSAND TEN
Kannada-0013-2855	THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN EDITION OF THE WORLD CUP HAD PLENTY OF SIMILAR SUBPLOTS 
Kannada-0013-2856	THERE WAS CONTROVERSY WHEN A GROUP OF SWISS PLAYERS OF KOSOVAN ORIGIN CELEBRATED THEIR GOALS AGAINST SERBIA BY MAKING THE SHAPE OF AN EAGLE A SYMBOL OF KOSOVAN NATIONALISM 
Kannada-0013-2857	AND MORE THAN ONE FOOTBALL PUNDIT BEMOANED THE FACT THAT BY THE SEMIFINALS THE REMAINING TEAMS WERE ALL FROM EUROPE
Kannada-0013-2858	BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO BIGGER POLITICAL TALKINGPOINT THAN THE IDENTITY OF THE WINNING FRENCH TEAM
Kannada-0013-2859	THAT DEL IF HE HAD NEEDED THE ROYAL MERCY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT IS NOT VERY PROBABLE 
Kannada-0013-2860	IT IS CERTAIN THAT EVERY ADVANTAGE WHICH THE LETTER OF THE LAW GAVE TO THE GOVERNMENT WAS USED AGAINST HIM WITHOUT SCRUPLE OR SHAME 
Kannada-0013-2861	HE WAS IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION FROM THAT IN WHICH STAMFORD STOOD 
Kannada-0013-2862	THE INDICTMENT AGAINST STAMFORD HAD BEEN REMOVED INTO THE HOUSE OF LORDS DURING THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT 
Kannada-0013-2863	AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE PROSECUTED TILL THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD REASSEMBLE 
Kannada-0013-2864	ALL THE PEERS WOULD THEN HAVE VOICES AND WOULD BE JUDGES AS WELL OF LAW AS OF FACT 
Kannada-0013-2865	BUT THE BILL AGAINST DEL WAS NOT FOUND TILL AFTER THE PROROGATION
Kannada-0013-2866	HE WAS THEREFORE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT OF THE LORD HIGH STEWARD 
Kannada-0013-2867	THIS COURT TO WHICH BELONGS DURING A RECESS OF PARLIAMENT THE COGNIZANCE OF TREASONS AND FELONIES COMMITTED BY TEMPORAL PEERS 
Kannada-0013-2868	WAS THEN SO CONSTITUTED THAT NO PRISONER CHARGED WITH A POLITICAL OFFENCE COULD EXPECT AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL 
Kannada-0013-2869	THE KING NAMED A LORD HIGH STEWARD
Kannada-0013-2870	THE LORD HIGH STEWARD NAMED AT HIS DISCRETION CERTAIN PEERS TO SIT ON THEIR ACCUSED BROTHER
Kannada-0013-2871	THE NUMBER TO BE SUMMONED WAS INDEFINITE NO CHALLENGE WAS ALLOWED 
Kannada-0013-2872	A SIMPLE MAJORITY PROVIDED THAT IT CONSISTED OF TWELVE WAS SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT 
Kannada-0013-2873	THE HIGH STEWARD WAS SOLE JUDGE OF THE LAW AND THE LORDS TRIERS FORMED MERELY A JURY TO PRONOUNCE ON THE QUESTION OF FACT

Kannada-0015-2917	WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO CELEBRATE FRANCES MULTIETHNIC AND MULTIRELIGIOUS COMPOSITION
Kannada-0015-2918	WOULD THIS NOT ALLOW THE FRENCH TO FACE UP TO THE WAVES OF IMMIGRATION THAT ARE THE MOST VISIBLE LEGACY OF A VIOLENT COLONIAL PAST
Kannada-0015-2919	PERHAPS IT WOULD BUT THINGS ARE NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE 
Kannada-0015-2920	OVER THE PAST CENTURY AND A HALF FRANCE HAS RECEIVED AND SUCCESSFULLY ABSORBED MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPE AFRICA ASIA THE PACIFIC AND THE CARIBBEAN 
Kannada-0015-2921	FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAVE WANTED TO BECOME FRENCH AND HAVE CLUNG TIGHTLY TO THEIR FRENCH IDENTITY 
Kannada-0015-2922	THIS WAS TRUE EVEN DURING MOMENTS OF CRISIS LIKE THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN THE FRENCH STATE TRIED TO STRIP SOME OF THEM OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP
Kannada-0015-2923	MOREOVER LARGESCALE SURVEYS OF SOCIAL ATTITUDES OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES SHOW CLEARLY THAT THE FRENCH ARE BECOMING MORE TOLERANT IN THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS RACE ETHNICITY AND ORIGIN
Kannada-0015-2924	THE FACT THAT MORE FRENCH PEOPLE THAN EVER ARE WILLING TO CALL THEIR COUNTRY RACIST DOES NOT MEAN THAT FRANCE TODAY IS MORE RACIST THAN IT WAS HALF A CENTURY AGO
Kannada-0015-2925	HAS THIS DEEP ATTACHMENT TO CITIZENSHIP AND A GROWING TOLERANCE TOWARDS ETHNIC DIFFERENCE COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF FRANCES MUCHMALIGNED COLOURBLIND REPUBLICANISM

Kannada-0015-2929	BUT THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE LIFE STORIES OF THE PLAYERS OR THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR COUNTRY
Kannada-0015-2930	SOME OF THE TEAMS MOST ICONIC STARS LIKE PAUL  KANT AND MAYOR ARE PURE PRODUCTS OF CONTEMPORARY FRANCE 
Kannada-0015-2931	THEY GREW UP IN DEPRESSED NEIGHBOURHOODS ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS 
Kannada-0015-2932	THEY WENT TO FRENCH SCHOOLS AND THEIR ONLY FOOTBALLING DREAM WAS TO EMULATE THE GREAT FRENCH TEAM OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
Kannada-0015-2933	THEY WILL KNOW THE DIFFICULT STORIES OF THEIR IMMIGRANT PARENTS AND THEY WILL HAVE SUFFERED INTENSE RACISM WHILE GROWING UP
Kannada-0015-2934	BUT THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN PARIS OR LYON THAN BAMAKO OR CASABLANCA
Kannada-0015-2935	PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE ONLY YOUNG FOOTBALLERS
Kannada-0015-2936	RATHER THAN FORCE ON THEM AN AFRICAN IDENTITY THEY MAY OR MAY NOT CHOOSE TO INHABIT

Kannada-0016-2958	AND THEREFORE EQUIVALENCE WITH A JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT IN MATTERS OF PAY ALLOWANCES AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE 
Kannada-0016-2959	THE CENTRE WILL ALSO FIX THE TERMS FOR STATE INFORMATION COMMISSIONERS 
Kannada-0016-2960	THIS IS AN ILLADVISED MOVE AND SHOULD BE JUNKED WITHOUT STANDING ON PRESTIGE 
Kannada-0016-2961	IF AT ALL THE LAW NEEDS TO BE AMENDED ONLY TO BRING ABOUT FULL COMPLIANCE BY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING FROM THE EXCHEQUER 
Kannada-0016-2962	AND TO EXTEND ITS SCOPE TO MORE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON OFFICIAL POLICY 
Kannada-0016-2963	THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION AS BEING INTEGRAL TO THE RIGHT TO FREE EXPRESSION UNDER ARTICLE NINETEEN WEAKENING THE TRANSPARENCY LAW WOULD NEGATE THAT GUARANTEE
Kannada-0016-2964	IN ITS RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENTS THE CENTRE HAS MAINTAINED THAT UNLIKE THE EC INFORMATION COMMISSIONS ARE NOT CONSTITUTIONAL BODIES BUT MERE STATUTORY CREATIONS UNDER THE LAW 
Kannada-0016-2965	THIS IS A NARROW VIEW BETRAYING AN ANXIETY TO TIGHTEN THE HOLD OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE COMMISSIONS WHICH EVEN NOW GET LITTLE OFFICIAL SUPPORT TO FILL VACANCIES AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

Kannada-0016-2987	HAD BEEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FORMED A CORRECT JUDGMENT OF HIS CHARACTER

Kannada-0017-3004	WHILE THE RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONS IS WELCOME IT ISNT THE ONLY IRRITANT IN THE USINDIA RELATIONSHIP 
Kannada-0017-3005	THAT NEEDS THE ATTENTION OF THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE MINISTERS AT THE TWO PLUS TWO DIALOGUE WITH THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER

Kannada-0017-3007	AS DO POSSIBLE PUNITIVE MEASURES AT THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION OVER TARIFFS AND COUNTERTARIFFS THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE IMPOSED ON EACH OTHER

Kannada-0017-3014	THE GOVERNMENTS BAN IGNORES THIS AND IS MOTIVATED INSTEAD BY THE MISUSE OF THE HORMONE IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY 
Kannada-0017-3015	BECAUSE OXYTOCIN STIMULATES LACTATION IN CATTLE DAIRY FARMERS INJECT THE DRUG INDISCRIMINATELY TO INCREASE MILK PRODUCTION 
Kannada-0017-3016	THIS HAS SPAWNED SEVERAL UNLICENSED FACILITIES THAT MANUFACTURE THE DRUG FOR VETERINARY USE IT IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS SOLVING 
Kannada-0017-3017	BUT THE RIGHT APPROACH WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STRENGTHEN REGULATION AND CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL PRODUCTION 
Kannada-0017-3018	MUCH IS UNKNOWN ABOUT THE ILLEFFECTS OF OXYTOCIN ON CATTLE 
Kannada-0017-3019	ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT OXYTOCIN LEADS TO INFERTILITY IN DAIRY ANIMALS AND SOME STUDIES SHOW THIS TO BE TRUE 
Kannada-0017-3020	JAMES NOW TOOK A STEP WHICH GREATLY DISCONCERTED THE WHOLE ANGLICAN PARTY 
Kannada-0017-3021	TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS
Kannada-0017-3022	HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLESS STRONG BOX AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING 
Kannada-0017-3023	THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED A ROMAN CATHOLIC 
Kannada-0017-3024	ONE OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM THE MANUSCRIPTS WERE EXHIBITED WAS ARCHBISHOP SANCROFT 
Kannada-0017-3025	HE READ THEM WITH MUCH EMOTION AND REMAINED SILENT 
Kannada-0017-3026	SUCH SILENCE WAS ONLY THE NATURAL EFFECT OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN RESPECT AND VEXATION 
Kannada-0017-3027	BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY 
Kannada-0017-3028	LET ME HAVE A SOLID ANSWER AND IN A GENTLEMANLIKE STYLE AND IT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT WHICH YOU SO MUCH DESIRE OF BRINGING ME OVER TO YOUR CHURCH 
Kannada-0017-3029	THE ARCHBISHOP MILDLY SAID THAT IN HIS OPINION SUCH AN ANSWER MIGHT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY BE WRITTEN 
Kannada-0017-3030	BUT DECLINED THE CONTROVERSY ON THE PLEA OF REVERENCE FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER 
Kannada-0017-3031	THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE OF A VANQUISHED DISPUTANT
Kannada-0017-3032	HAD HE BEEN WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE POLEMICAL LITERATURE OF THE PRECEDING CENTURY AND A HALF

Kannada-0019-3083	THE QUALITY COUNCIL OF INDIA DID NOT FOLLOW ACCREDITATION NORMS CREATED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING
Kannada-0019-3084	IT APPEARS THAT NEITHER SCALE NOR STANDARD WAS ACHIEVED BUT ONLY SPEED

Kannada-0019-3089	THE NCVT IS JUST A STAMP WITH NO ROLE IN ACTUALLY ASSESSING QUALITY HOW CAN QUALITY OUTCOMES BE EXPECTED WITHOUT QUALITY ASSESSMENTS
Kannada-0019-3090	THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE HAS SHED LIGHT ON THE ITIS
Kannada-0019-3091	IF THE SAME EXERCISE WERE EXTENDED TO OTHER SKILL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES THE PICTURE WOULD BE GRIMMER 
Kannada-0019-3092	THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE CASES PENDING IN HIGH COURTS ON NONCOMPLIANCE OF NORMS BY THE ITIS 
Kannada-0019-3093	HOWEVER THE SHORTTERM TRAINING PROGRAMMES OF THE MINISTRY EVADE ANY SCRUTINY AND ACTION 
Kannada-0019-3094	FOR EXAMPLE THE STANDARD TRAINING ASSESSMENT AND REWARD SCHEME SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY CRORE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEENFOURTEEN WITH NO NORMS FOR QUALITY 
Kannada-0019-3095	THERE WERE NO AADHAAR CHECKS ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS AND BATCH SIZE LIMITATIONS PRIVATE TRAINING OPERATORS HAVE MADE A PROFIT WITH NO COURT CASES

Kannada-0019-3097	THEY OFFERED TRAINING IN LESS THAN FIVE TRADES HAD FEWER CLASSROOMS AND WORKSHOPS FOR PRACTICE AND THEIR TEACHERS WERE VERY POORLY PAID
Kannada-0019-3098	SO WHAT CAN WE DO SYSTEMICALLY A GOOD POINT TO START WOULD BE THE SHARDA PRASAD COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
Kannada-0019-3099	WE NEED BETTER OVERSIGHT WITH A NATIONAL BOARD FOR ALL SKILL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES

Kannada-0031-3563	HIS RANKING WAS ENABLED BY HIS TWO HUNDRED RUNS ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTY NINE IN THE FIRST INNINGS AND FIFTY ONE IN THE SECOND IN THE FIRST TEST IN BIRMINGHAM WHICH ALMOST TOOK INDIA TO VICTORY

Kannada-0031-3569	HIS DISMAL SHOWING DURING INDIAS PREVIOUS TOUR OF ENGLAND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH JUST ONE THIRTY FOUR RUNS FROM TEN INNINGS COULD NOT BE IGNORED 
Kannada-0031-3570	KOHLI IS CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF IN AWAY TOURS 
Kannada-0031-3571	ONCE HE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS DREAM TO SCORE A TEST TON AGAINST DALE STEYN AND COMPANY IN SOUTH AFRICA AND WENT ON TO PROMPTLY DO SO IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN 
Kannada-0031-3572	ENGLAND PRESENTS AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO HIM 
Kannada-0031-3573	FOR ONE IT IS A PERSONAL POINT TO PROVE AGAINST JAMES ANDERSON WHO HAD IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DISMISSED KOHLI ON FOUR OCCASIONS 
Kannada-0031-3574	HE HAS CLEARLY LEARNT TO PLAY ANDERSON AND IN BIRMINGHAM HIS LINE AROUND THE OFFSTUMP WAS EITHER COUNTERED WITH A STRAIGHT BAT AND SOFT HANDS OR LEFT ALONE

Kannada-0031-3583	THE CATASTROPHIC IMPACT OF MONSOON RAINFALL ON SEVERAL DISTRICTS OF KERALA HAS COME AS A GRIM REMINDER THAT THE VIGIL AGAINST UNPREDICTABLE NATURAL DISASTERS MUST NEVER BE RELAXED

Kannada-0032-3602	IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICTS DAMAGE TO HOUSES ROADS AND OTHER STRUCTURES HAS OCCURRED OWING TO LANDSLIPS CAUSED BY INCESSANT SHOWERS 
Kannada-0032-3603	THERE IS GENUINE CONCERN THAT A TEMPORARY RESPITE IN RAINFALL MAY BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER INTENSE DOWNPOUR FROM NASCENT WEATHER SYSTEMS
Kannada-0032-3604	THE INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT HAS FORECAST RAIN UNTIL AUGUST SEVENTEEN 
Kannada-0032-3605	IT IS TO KERALAS CREDIT THAT THE DELUGE HAS LED NOT TO A PARTISAN BLAME GAME OVER PLANNING RELIEF AND REHABILITATION BUT AN ALLROUND EFFORT TO LOOK AHEAD AND PLAN FOR RECONSTRUCTION
Kannada-0032-3606	THE CENTRE HAS DONE WELL TO GET A FIRSTHAND ESTIMATE OF THE HAVOC FROM HOME MINISTER RAJNATH SINGH 
Kannada-0032-3607	ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF ONE HUNDRED CRORE TOWARDS RELIEF IS INCONGRUOUS WITH THE SCALE OF THE DAMAGE 
Kannada-0032-3608	CRUCIAL SUPPORT HAS COME FROM THE ARMED FORCES AS WELL TO NORMALISE THE SITUATION
Kannada-0032-3609	KERALAS UNUSUALLY HEAVY MONSOON THIS YEAR IS IN CONTRAST TO THE LONGPERIOD TREND OF RAINFALL 
Kannada-0032-3610	ACCORDING TO AN ANALYSIS OF DATA ON THE MONSOON BETWEEN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND THREE BY CLIMATE RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE
Kannada-0032-3611	OVERALL THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY HAD BECOME DRIER IN SUMMER BUT WITH AN EMERGING FREQUENCY OF DESTRUCTIVE FLASH FLOODS IN RARE EVENTS THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO BECOME STRONGER 
Kannada-0032-3612	THIS POINTS TO THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR RESILIENCE PLANNING 
Kannada-0032-3613	IT SHOULD BEGIN WITH A PROGRAMME TO RELOCATE PEOPLE AWAY FROM HAZARD ZONES ALONG THE RIVERS THAT WERE IN SPATE IN KERALA OVER THE PAST WEEK AFTER THE SHUTTERS OF MORE THAN TWO DOZEN DAMS WERE OPENED 
Kannada-0032-3614	FINDING SUITABLE LAND IS OF COURSE A CHALLENGE IN A POPULOUS FORESTED STATE BUT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE 
Kannada-0032-3615	IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT WITH ITS EFFICIENT PRIMARY HEALTH CARE NETWORK KERALA WILL TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO AVOID EPIDEMICS IN THE WAKE OF THE FLOODS 
Kannada-0032-3616	THE SPECTACULAR DISASTER THIS YEAR ALSO UNDERSCORES THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT AS THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN 
Kannada-0032-3617	IN MUMBAI LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE THOSE WHO HAD PRIVATE HOUSEHOLD INSURANCE COVER AGAINST DISASTERS DISCOVERED THE LIMITATIONS OF SUCH POLICIE 
Kannada-0032-3618	SINCE THE COMPANIES WERE UNWILLING TO PAY MANY HOME OWNERS FOR A KEY RISK SUCH AS COSTLY DISPLACEMENT FROM HOMES SINCE THE HOUSES WERE NOT STRUCTURALLY DAMAGED 
Kannada-0032-3619	ALL STATES NATURALLY LOOK TO KERALA WITH ITS RECORD OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EVOLVING BEST PRACTICES TO HANDLE SUCH NATURAL DISASTERS
Kannada-0032-3620	GOOD SENSE SEEMS TO HAVE PREVAILED AT LAST 
Kannada-0032-3621	THE CENTRE HAS CLEARED THE ELEVATION OF JUSTICE KM JOSEPH TO THE SUPREME COURT SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE FIVEMEMBER COLLEGIUM FIRST RECOMMENDED HIS APPOINTMENT 
Kannada-0032-3622	THE CENTRE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO ELEVATE THE UTTARAKHAND HIGH COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ONCE THE COLLEGIUM REITERATED ITS ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATION AFTER THE LAW MINISTRY RETURNED HIS NAME
Kannada-0032-3623	THE COLLEGIUM HAD COMBINED ITS REITERATION OF HIS NAME WITH TWO OTHER NAMES SO THAT THREE CHIEF JUSTICES COULD BE ELEVATED IN ONE GO 
Kannada-0032-3624	THE CENTRES OBJECTIONS TO JUSTICE JOSEPHS CANDIDATURE WERE UNCONVINCING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 
Kannada-0032-3625	IT MADE AN ISSUE OF HIS RELATIVE LACK OF SENIORITY AMONG THE CHIEF JUSTICES OF THE VARIOUS HIGH COURTS
Kannada-0032-3626	ADDING SOMEWHAT CURIOUSLY THAT HIS ELEVATION WOULD GIVE EXCESSIVE REPRESENTATION TO KERALA
Kannada-0032-3627	UNHAPPILY JAMES INSTEAD OF BECOMING A MEDIATOR BECAME THE FIERCEST AND MOST RECKLESS OF PARTISANS 
Kannada-0032-3628	INSTEAD OF ALLAYING THE ANIMOSITY OF THE TWO POPULATIONS HE INFLAMED IT TO A HEIGHT BEFORE UNKNOWN 
Kannada-0032-3629	HE DETERMINED TO REVERSE THEIR RELATIVE POSITION AND TO PUT THE PROTESTANT COLONISTS UNDER THE FEET OF THE POPISH CELTS 
Kannada-0032-3630	TO BE OF THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION TO BE OF THE ENGLISH BLOOD WAS IN HIS VIEW A DISQUALIFICATION FOR CIVIL AND MILITARY EMPLOYMENT 
Kannada-0032-3631	HE MEDITATED THE DESIGN OF AGAIN CONFISCATING AND AGAIN PORTIONING OUT THE SOIL OF HALF THE ISLAND AND SHOWED HIS INCLINATION SO CLEARLY THAT ONE CLASS WAS SOON AGITATED BY TERRORS 
Kannada-0032-3632	WHICH HE AFTERWARDS VAINLY WISHED TO SOOTHE AND THE OTHER BY HOPES WHICH HE AFTERWARDS VAINLY WISHED TO RESTRAIN 
Kannada-0032-3633	BUT THIS WAS THE SMALLEST PART OF HIS GUILT AND MADNESS 
Kannada-0032-3634	HE DELIBERATELY RESOLVED NOT MERELY TO GIVE TO THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF IRELAND THE ENTIRE POSSESSION OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY 
Kannada-0032-3635	BUT ALSO TO USE THEM AS HIS INSTRUMENTS FOR SETTING UP ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN ENGLAND 
Kannada-0032-3636	THE EVENT WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN THE COLONISTS TURNED TO BAY WITH THE STUBBORN HARDIHOOD OF THEIR RACE 
Kannada-0032-3637	THE MOTHER COUNTRY JUSTLY REGARDED THEIR CAUSE AS HER OWN THEN CAME A DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR A TREMENDOUS STAKE 
Kannada-0032-3638	EVERYTHING DEAR TO NATIONS WAS WAGERED ON BOTH SIDES NOR CAN WE JUSTLY BLAME EITHER THE IRISHMAN OR THE ENGLISHMAN FOR OBEYING IN THAT EXTREMITY THE LAW OF SELFPRESERVATION 
Kannada-0032-3639	THE CONTEST WAS TERRIBLE BUT SHORT THE WEAKER WENT DOWN HIS FATE WAS CRUEL AND YET FOR THE CRUELTY WITH WHICH HE WAS TREATED THERE WAS NOT INDEED A DEFENCE BUT AN EXCUSE 
Kannada-0032-3640	FOR THOUGH HE SUFFERED ALL THAT TYRANNY COULD INFLICT HE SUFFERED NOTHING THAT HE WOULD NOT HIMSELF HAVE INFLICTED 
Kannada-0032-3641	THE EFFECT OF THE INSANE ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE ENGLAND BY MEANS OF IRELAND WAS THAT THE IRISH BECAME HEWERS OF WOOD AND DRAWERS OF WATER TO THE ENGLISH

Kannada-0033-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0033-3642	IT ALSO SPOKE OF AN IMBALANCE IN REGIONAL REPRESENTATION IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THESE WERE NOT GOOD ENOUGH REASONS TO TURN DOWN HIS APPOINTMENT 
Kannada-0033-3643	IT ONLY SERVED TO STRENGTHEN THE SUSPICIONS THAT JUSTICE JOSEPH FOUND HIMSELF IN DISFAVOUR BECAUSE HE WAS ON A BENCH THAT QUASHED THE IMPOSITION OF PRESIDENTS RULE IN UTTARAKHAND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN 
Kannada-0033-3644	NOW THAT HIS ELEVATION IS ALL SET TO GO THROUGH THESE ISSUES MAY NOT APPEAR TO BE RELEVANT ANYMORE 
Kannada-0033-3645	HOWEVER IT IS DIFFICULT NOT TO SEE A PATTERN IN THE GOVERNMENTS CONDUCT 
Kannada-0033-3646	IT HAS BEEN SPLITTING RECOMMENDED LISTS AND SELECTIVELY APPROVING PROPOSALS FROM THE COLLEGIUM WHILE HOLDING BACK OR RETURNING SOME NAMES 
Kannada-0033-3647	IN THE CASE OF JUSTICE JOSEPH HIS NAME WAS SENT ALONG WITH THAT OF SENIOR ADVOCATE INDU MALHOTRA TO THE CENTRE IN JANUARY 
Kannada-0033-3648	HOWEVER THREE MONTHS LATER THE GOVERNMENT CLEARED ONLY ONE OF THE TWO NAMES WHILE SEEKING RECONSIDERATION OF JUSTICE JOSEPHS CANDIDATURE 
Kannada-0033-3649	SUCH DECISIONS TEND TO ALTER THE INTER SE SENIORITY AMONG SITTING JUDGES A FACTOR THAT DETERMINES WHO BECOMES CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA AND WHO JOINS THE COLLEGIUM
Kannada-0033-3650	THE CENTRES RIGHT TO SEEK THE RECONSIDERATION OF A RECOMMENDATION ON THE BASIS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT CANNOT BE DISPUTED
Kannada-0033-3651	BUT IT IS WORRYING THAT ONE OR TWO NAMES ARE HELD BACK FROM A NUMBER OF BATCHES 
Kannada-0033-3652	THE REASONS FOR SEEKING RECONSIDERATION NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY STATED IN EVERY SUCH INSTANCE
Kannada-0033-3653	EVEN IN ITS ADHERENCE TO THE NORM THAT REITERATION OF A RECOMMENDATION IS BINDING THE CENTRE HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT 
Kannada-0033-3654	RECENTLY IT RETURNED A RECOMMENDATION CONCERNING TWO APPOINTMENTS TO THE ALLAHABAD HIGH COURT FOR THE SECOND TIME 
Kannada-0033-3655	THE OTHER ISSUE IS DELAY THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR SITTING ON FILES WITHOUT TAKING A DECISION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE BACKLOG IN THE SUPREME COURT 
Kannada-0033-3656	THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY MAY HAVE COME TO A CLOSE BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER FLASHPOINTS CANNOT BE RULED OUT 
Kannada-0033-3657	IF THE JUDICIARY AND THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO DISPEL THE IMPRESSION OF A PROLONGED CONFLICT
Kannada-0033-3658	A FRESH MEMORANDUM OF PROCEDURE FOR APPOINTMENTS HAS TO BE AGREED UPON IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY IS HOLDING IT UP
Kannada-0033-3659	WITH MORE THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE YEAR AND TWO MONTHS OF THE MONSOON OVER IT IS TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE WHOLE YEAR IS GOING TO BE LIKE 
Kannada-0033-3660	ARE THERE SIGNS OF RECOVERY IF THERE ARE ARE THEY ROBUST WHAT ARE THE SHORT AND MEDIUMTERM CONCERNS OF THE COUNTRY
Kannada-0033-3661	THE MONSOON HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT BELOW EXPECTATIONS THE OVERALL RAINFALL DEFICIENCY WAS THREE PERCENT 
Kannada-0033-3662	THOUGH IT MAY SEEM NEGLIGIBLE IT HAS TO BE NOTED THAT THERE WERE ELEVEN METEOROLOGICAL DIVISIONS WHICH WERE DEFICIENT 
Kannada-0033-3663	THE AREA SOWN HAS COME DOWN RICEPRODUCING BIHAR FOR INSTANCE HAS BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED 
Kannada-0033-3664	HOWEVER THE MONSOON CAN PICK UP THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE FUTURE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MONSOON 
Kannada-0033-3665	AGRICULTURAL GROWTH MAY AT BEST BE EQUAL TO WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR THREE PONT FOUR PERCENT
Kannada-0033-3666	THE SERVICES SECTOR MAY PERFORM BETTER BECAUSE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE WILL BE MAINTAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL 
Kannada-0033-3667	THE BISHOPS WERE REPEATEDLY SENT OUT INTO THE ANTECHAMBER AND REPEATEDLY CALLED BACK INTO THE COUNCIL ROOM 
Kannada-0033-3668	AT LENGTH JAMES POSITIVELY COMMANDED THEM TO ANSWER THE QUESTION 
Kannada-0033-3669	HE DID NOT EXPRESSLY ENGAGE THAT THEIR CONFESSION SHOULD NOT BE USED AGAINST THEM 
Kannada-0033-3670	BUT THEY NOT UNNATURALLY SUPPOSED THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED SUCH AN ENGAGEMENT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS COMMAND 
Kannada-0033-3671	SANCROFT ACKNOWLEDGED HIS HANDWRITING AND HIS BRETHREN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE 
Kannada-0033-3672	THEY WERE THEN INTERROGATED ABOUT THE MEANING OF SOME WORDS IN THE PETITION 
Kannada-0033-3673	AND ABOUT THE LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED WITH SO MUCH EFFECT ALL OVER THE KINGDOM
Kannada-0033-3674	BUT THEIR LANGUAGE WAS SO GUARDED THAT NOTHING WAS GAINED BY THE EXAMINATION 
Kannada-0033-3675	THE CHANCELLOR THEN TOLD THEM THAT A CRIMINAL INFORMATION WOULD BE EXHIBITED AGAINST THEM IN THE COURT OF KINGS BENCH AND CALLED UPON THEM TO ENTER INTO RECOGNISANCES 
Kannada-0033-3676	THEY REFUSED THEY WERE PEERS OF THE REALM THEY SAID 
Kannada-0033-3677	THEY WERE ADVISED BY THE BEST LAWYERS IN WESTMINSTER HALL THAT NO PEER COULD BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO A RECOGNISANCE IN A CASE OF LIBEL
Kannada-0033-3678	AND THEY SHOULD NOT THINK THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN RELINQUISHING THE PRIVILEGE OF THEIR ORDER 
Kannada-0033-3679	THE KING WAS SO ABSURD AS TO THINK HIMSELF PERSONALLY AFFRONTED BECAUSE THEY CHOSE ON A LEGAL QUESTION TO BE GUIDED BY LEGAL ADVICE 
Kannada-0033-3680	YOU BELIEVE EVERYBODY HE SAID RATHER THAN ME HE WAS INDEED MORTIFIED AND ALARMED 
Kannada-0033-3681	FOR HE HAD GONE SO FAR THAT IF THEY PERSISTED HE HAD NO CHOICE LEFT BUT TO SEND THEM TO PRISON

Kannada-0035-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0035-3723	THE RBIS LATEST REPORT ON FINANCIAL STABILITY SHOWS THAT THE GROSS NONPERFORMING ASSET RATIO OF SCHEDULED COMMERCIAL BANKS ROSE TO ELEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT
Kannada-0035-3724	THE RATIO FOR PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS WAS FIFTEEN POINT SIX PECENT THIS IS INDEED A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF NPAS 
Kannada-0035-3725	SOME PART OF THE INCREASE IS ALSO DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF A MORE RIGOROUS DEFINITION OF NPAS
Kannada-0035-3726	THE HIGH NPA LEVEL HAS A DAMPENING EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF NEW CREDIT 
Kannada-0035-3727	IN FACT CREDIT TO THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR HAS SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY RECAPITALISATION OF BANKS HAS BECOME AN URGENT NECESSITY 
Kannada-0035-3728	OF COURSE THIS WILL IMPOSE A SERIOUS BURDEN ON THE FISCAL POSITION 
Kannada-0035-3729	MANY SUGGESTIONS WHICH INCLUDE ASSET RECONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE THE NPA ISSUE A QUICK DECISION HAS TO BE MADE 
Kannada-0035-3730	UNLESS THE BANKING SYSTEM RECOVERS FAST IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN A HIGH GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR 
Kannada-0035-3731	MEDIUMTERM BANKING REFORMS WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS RESOLVEDTHE THIRD CONCERN RELATES TO THE FISCAL POSITION 
Kannada-0035-3732	SO FAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS FISC HAS BEEN WITHIN LIMITS 
Kannada-0035-3733	AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER THE FISCAL DEFICIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEFICIT FOR THE YEAR AS A WHOLE WAS SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT A STRONG IMPROVEMENT OVER THE DEFICIT IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD LAST YEAR
Kannada-0035-3734	THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THE FISC WHICH NEED TO BE KEPT UNDER WATCH ONE RELATES TO GST 
Kannada-0035-3735	IT IS ESTIMATED THAT GST REVENUES ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING BEHIND BUDGETARY PROJECTIONS PERHAPS REVENUES MAY PICK UP IN THE SECOND HALF BUT ONE DOESNT KNOW 
Kannada-0035-3736	IT IS ALSO NOT CLEAR HOW MUCH OF THE REFUNDS ARE OUTSTANDING ANY SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALL CAN PUT THE FISC UNDER STRESS
Kannada-0035-3737	THE SECOND CONCERN RELATES TO THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICES FOR VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES 
Kannada-0035-3738	THE MSPS HAVE BEEN RAISED SHARPLY IN THE CASE OF SOME COMMODITIES 
Kannada-0035-3739	EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF RICE AND WHEAT  THERE IS NO INDICATION OF HOW THE MSPS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN RELATION TO OTHER COMMODITIES 
Kannada-0035-3740	IF MARKET PRICES FALL BELOW MSPS THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS IN WHICH FARMERS CAN BE ASSURED OF THE MINIMUM PRICE 
Kannada-0035-3741	ONE IS THE MP MODEL WHERE THE STATE PAYS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKET PRICE AND MSP
Kannada-0035-3742	BUT THIS CAN TURN OUT TO BE A SERIOUS BURDEN IF MARKET PRICES FALL STEEPLY 
Kannada-0035-3743	THIS IS APART FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING THE SCHEME 
Kannada-0035-3744	THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE EXCESS PRODUCTION OVER NORMAL PRODUCTION SO THAT MARKET PRICES RISE 
Kannada-0035-3745	THIS ALTERNATIVE MAY BE LESS BURDENSOME HOWEVER THIS ALTERNATIVE WILL NOT WORK IF THE MSP IS FIXED AT A LEVEL TO WHICH THE MARKET PRICE WILL NEVER RISE 
Kannada-0035-3746	THUS THE BURDEN ON THE GOVERNMENT AS A RESULT OF THE NEW MSPS IS UNCERTAIN AND NEEDS TO BE WATCHED 
Kannada-0035-3747	THE POSSIBILITY OF CUTTING EXPENDITURES IF REVENUES FALL BELOW PROJECTIONS IS REMOTE IN A YEAR BEFORE ELECTIONS
Kannada-0035-3748	HE MIGHT WELL BE OUT OF TEMPER HIS DEFEAT HAD BEEN COMPLETE AND MOST HUMILIATING 
Kannada-0035-3749	HAD THE PRELATES ESCAPED ON ACCOUNT OF SOME TECHNICAL DEFECT IN THE CASE FOR THE CROWN HAD THEY ESCAPED BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT WRITTEN THE PETITION IN MIDDLESEX 
Kannada-0035-3750	OR BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE ACCORDING TO THE STRICT RULES OF LAW THAT THEY HAD DELIVERED TO THE KING THE PAPER FOR WHICH THEY WERE CALLED IN QUESTION THE PREROGATIVE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED NO SHOCK 
Kannada-0035-3751	HAPPILY FOR THE COUNTRY THE FACT OF PUBLICATION HAD BEEN FULLY ESTABLISHED 
Kannada-0035-3752	THE COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE HAD THEREFORE BEEN FORCED TO ATTACK THE DISPENSING POWERTHEY HAD ATTACKED IT WITH GREAT LEARNING ELOQUENCE AND BOLDNESS 
Kannada-0035-3753	THE ADVOCATES OF THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN BY UNIVERSAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OVERMATCHED IN THE CONTEST 
Kannada-0035-3754	NOT A SINGLE JUDGE HAD VENTURED TO DECLARE THAT THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE WAS LEGAL

Kannada-0035-3756	THE LANGUAGE OF THE WHOLE TOWN WAS THAT THE DISPENSING POWER HAD RECEIVED A FATAL BLOW 
Kannada-0035-3757	FINCH WHO HAD THE DAY BEFORE BEEN UNIVERSALLY REVILED WAS NOW UNIVERSALLY APPLAUDED 
Kannada-0035-3758	HE HAD BEEN UNWILLING IT WAS SAID TO LET THE CASE BE DECIDED IN A WAY WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION STILL DOUBTFUL 
Kannada-0035-3759	HE HAD FELT THAT A VERDICT WHICH SHOULD ACQUIT HIS CLIENTS WITHOUT CONDEMNING THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE WOULD BE BUT HALF A VICTORY 
Kannada-0035-3760	IT IS CERTAIN THAT FINCH DESERVED NEITHER THE REPROACHES WHICH HAD BEEN CAST ON HIM WHILE THE EVENT WAS DOUBTFUL NOR THE PRAISES WHICH HE RECEIVED WHEN IT HAD PROVED HAPPY 
Kannada-0035-3761	IT WAS ABSURD TO BLAME HIM BECAUSE DURING THE SHORT DELAY WHICH HE OCCASIONED THE CROWN LAWYERS UNEXPECTEDLY DISCOVERED NEW EVIDENCE 
Kannada-0035-3762	IT WAS EQUALLY ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT HE DELIBERATELY EXPOSED HIS CLIENTS TO RISK IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL PRINCIPLE 
Kannada-0035-3763	AND STILL MORE ABSURD WAS IT TO PRAISE HIM FOR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GROSS VIOLATION OF PROFESSIONAL DUTY

Kannada-0037-3844	SINCE THEN SAUDI ARABIA HAS ALLOWED WOMEN TO DRIVE CRACKED DOWN ON HARDLINERS AMONG THE CLERGY AND PROJECTED ITSELF AS A MODERATE ISLAMIC COUNTRY
Kannada-0037-3845	BUT WHEN CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CHRYSTIA FREELAND CALLED FOR THE RELEASE OF SAMAR BADAWI A SAUDI WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVIST 
Kannada-0037-3846	WHO WAS DETAINED LAST WEEK AND HER BROTHER RAIF BADAWI RIYADH TOOK A SERIES OF UNILATERAL STEPS 
Kannada-0037-3847	TERMING MS FREELANDS APPEAL AS INTERFERENCE IN ITS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS IT EXPELLED THE CANADIAN AMBASSADOR CALLED BACK ITS ENVOY FROM OTTAWA
Kannada-0037-3848	FROZE TRADE WITH CANADA AND SAID IT WOULD TRANSFER OUT SOME TWELVE THOUSAND SAUDI CITIZENS STUDYING IN CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES
Kannada-0037-3849	MS BADAWI HAS LONG CAMPAIGNED AGAINST SAUDI ARABIAS GUARDIANSHIP LAWS THAT REQUIRE ALL SAUDI WOMEN TO HAVE A MALE GUARDIAN 
Kannada-0037-3850	RIYADH IS YET TO GIVE REASONS FOR THE ARREST HER BROTHER WHO RAN A WEBSITE CRITICAL OF THE SAUDI RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT WAS SENTENCED TO TEN YEARS IN JAIL AND ONE THOUSAND LASHES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN
Kannada-0037-3851	ON OVERSEAS VISITS PRINCE MOHAMMED HAS DWELT ON HIS PLAN TO IMPROVE WOMENS RIGHTS AND STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY 
Kannada-0037-3852	HE IS ALSO OBLIQUELY CRITICAL OF THE GUARDIANSHIP LAWS SAYING THEY DID NOT EXIST IN SAUDI ARABIA BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE YEAR OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND THE SIEGE OF THE GRAND MOSQUE AT MECCA 
Kannada-0037-3853	BUT DESPITE THIS RHETORIC ON RIGHTS THE PALACE HAS SHOWN LITTLE TOLERANCE OF POLITICAL CRITICISM AT HOME 
Kannada-0037-3854	SINCE MAY MANY WOMENS RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAVE BEEN DETAINED 
Kannada-0037-3855	IN ADDITION DOZENS OF LAWYERS HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND INTELLECTUALS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED SINCE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN 
Kannada-0037-3856	INTERESTINGLY WHILE MOST WESTERN GOVERNMENTS REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE CRACKDOWN AGAINST DISSENT IN SAUDI ARABIA CANADA HAS GIVEN REFUGE TO MR BADAWIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
Kannada-0037-3857	FOR CANADA THE SPAT COULD PROVE COSTLY SAUDI ARABIA IS ITS SECOND LARGEST EXPORT DESTINATION IN WEST ASIA 
Kannada-0037-3858	THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED A TWELVE BILLION ARMS DEAL WHICH IS STILL IN THE WORKS 
Kannada-0037-3859	BUT DESPITE THE AGGRESSIVE SAUDI RESPONSE OTTAWA HAD STOOD BY ITS FOREIGN MINISTER SAYING IT WILL CONTINUE TO BACK THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INCLUDING WOMENS RIGHTS 
Kannada-0037-3860	FOR PRINCE MOHAMMED THE DIPLOMATIC CRISIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE KINGDOMS APPROACH TOWARDS DISSENT AND DIPLOMACY

Kannada-0037-3862	TAKING VENGEFUL ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO STAND BY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WILL NEITHER HELP SAUDI ARABIAS IMAGE NOR ATTRACT INVESTMENT INTO THE COUNTRY
Kannada-0037-3863	THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN THE COUNTRY IS FINALLY SPEEDING UP 
Kannada-0037-3864	A TASK FORCE OF THE UNION COMMERCE MINISTRY HAS SUBMITTED THE DRAFT NATIONAL POLICY ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Kannada-0037-3865	WHICH WILL NOW BE STUDIED BY A SEVENTYMEMBER THINK TANK CHAIRED BY SURESH PRABHU THE UNION COMMERCE INDUSTRY AND CIVIL AVIATION MINISTER 
Kannada-0037-3866	INDIAS ETAIL BUSINESS ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH AROUND TWENTY FIVE BILLION IS STILL A FRACTION OF THE OVERALL RETAIL SECTOR IN THE COUNTRY 
Kannada-0037-3867	BUT IT HAS BEEN WITNESS TO SOME FRENETIC ACTIVITY OF LATE INCLUDING THE MERGER BETWEEN HOMEGROWN BUT SINGAPOREBASED FLIPKART AND GLOBAL GIANT WALMART 
Kannada-0037-3868	OVER THE COMING DECADE THE ECOMMERCE PIE IS EXPECTED TO SWELL TO TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FUELLED BY SMARTPHONES CHEAPER DATA ACCESS AND GROWING SPENDS 
Kannada-0037-3869	OF THE MANY ERRORS WHICH JAMES COMMITTED NONE WAS MORE FATAL THAN THIS 
Kannada-0037-3870	ALREADY HE HAD ALIENATED THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE BY VIOLATING THEIR LAWS CONFISCATING THEIR ESTATES AND PERSECUTING THEIR RELIGION 
Kannada-0037-3871	OF THOSE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN MOST ZEALOUS FOR MONARCHY HE HAD ALREADY MADE MANY REBELS IN HEART 
Kannada-0037-3872	YET HE MIGHT STILL WITH SOME CHANCE OF SUCCESS HAVE APPEALED TO THE PATRIOTIC SPIRIT OF HIS SUBJECTS AGAINST AN INVADER 
Kannada-0037-3873	FOR THEY WERE A RACE INSULAR IN TEMPER AS WELL AS IN GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION 
Kannada-0037-3874	THEIR NATIONAL ANTIPATHIES WERE INDEED IN THAT AGE UNREASONABLY AND UNAMIABLY STRONG NEVER HAD THE ENGLISH BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTROL OF INTERFERENCE OF ANY STRANGER 
Kannada-0037-3875	THE APPEARANCE OF A FOREIGN ARMY ON THEIR SOIL MIGHT IMPEL THEM TO RALLY EVEN ROUND A KING WHOM THEY HAD NO REASON TO LOVE 
Kannada-0037-3876	WILLIAM MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OVERCOME THIS DIFFICULTY BUT JAMES REMOVED IT
Kannada-0037-3877	NOT EVEN THE ARRIVAL OF A BRIGADE OF LEWISS MUSKETEERS WOULD HAVE EXCITED SUCH RESENTMENT AND SHAME AS OUR ANCESTORS FELT WHEN THEY SAW ARMED COLUMNS OF PAPISTS 
Kannada-0037-3878	JUST ARRIVED FROM DUBLIN MOVING IN MILITARY POMP ALONG THE HIGH ROADS NO MAN OF ENGLISH BLOOD THEN REGARDED THE ABORIGINAL IRISH AS HIS COUNTRYMEN 
Kannada-0037-3879	THEY DID NOT BELONG TO OUR BRANCH OF THE GREAT HUMAN FAMILY THEY WERE DISTINGUISHED FROM US BY MORE THAN ONE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL PECULIARITY WHICH THE DIFFERENCE OF SITUATION AND OF EDUCATION GREAT AS THAT DIFFERENCE WAS DID NOT SEEM ALTOGETHER TO EXPLAIN 
Kannada-0037-3880	THEY HAD AN ASPECT OF THEIR OWN A MOTHER TONGUE OF THEIR OWN WHEN THEY TALKED ENGLISH THEIR PRONUNCIATION WAS LUDICROUS THEIR PHRASEOLOGY WAS GROTESQUE 
Kannada-0037-3881	AS IS ALWAYS THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THOSE WHO THINK IN ONE LANGUAGE AND EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS IN ANOTHER THEY WERE THEREFORE FOREIGNERS 
Kannada-0037-3882	AND OF ALL FOREIGNERS THEY WERE THE MOST HATED AND DESPISED THE MOST HATED FOR THEY HAD DURING FIVE CENTURIES ALWAYS BEEN OUR ENEMIES

Kannada-0039-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0039-3924	THE DRAFT POLICY PROPOSES THE CREATION OF A SINGLE NATIONAL REGULATOR TO OVERSEE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY
Kannada-0039-3925	ALTHOUGH OPERATIONALISING ITS DIFFERENT FEATURES WOULD REQUIRE ACTION FROM MULTIPLE MINISTRIES AND REGULATORS 
Kannada-0039-3926	THIS WOULD ALSO NEED AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING LEGISLATION AND RULEBOOKS 
Kannada-0039-3927	CONSUMER PROTECTION NORMS TO GUARD ONLINE SHOPPERS FROM POSSIBLE FRAUDS TOO ARE OVERDUE
Kannada-0039-3928	AS PER DATA AVAILABLE FOR THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEENEIGHTEEN OVER FIFTY THOUSAND ECOMMERCE GRIEVANCES WERE MADE TO THE CONSUMER AFFAIRS MINISTRY HELPLINE 
Kannada-0039-3929	TRADITIONAL RETAILERS TOO HAVE VOICED CONCERNS ABOUT LARGE ETAIL PLAYERS WITH DEEP POCKETS PRICING THEM OUT OF THE MARKET AND HAVE BEEN SEEKING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
Kannada-0039-3930	MUCH WORK HOWEVER REMAINS TO BE DONE TO FORGE A COHESIVE FRAMEWORK FROM THE DRAFT
Kannada-0039-3931	AMONG THE IDEAS IN THE DRAFT POLICY ARE A SUNSET CLAUSE ON DISCOUNTS THAT CAN BE OFFERED BY ECOMMERCE FIRMS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SELLERS BACKED BY MARKETPLACE OPERATORS 
Kannada-0039-3932	THE AIM MAY BE TO PREVENT LARGE PLAYERS FROM PRICING OUT THE COMPETITION THROUGH UNFAIR PRACTICES BUT TAKEN TOO FAR SUCH LICENSING AND PRICE CONTROLS CAN DEPRESS THE SECTOR 
Kannada-0039-3933	TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT A SAY ON WHO CAN OFFER HOW MUCH DISCOUNT AND FOR HOW LONG INSTEAD OF LETTING CONSUMERS EXERCISE INFORMED CHOICES WOULD BE A REGRESSIVE STEP FOR THE ECONOMY
Kannada-0039-3934	FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS ON PLAYERS WHO CAN HOLD THEIR OWN INVENTORY ARE SOUGHT TO BE LIFTED
Kannada-0039-3935	BUT THERE MUST BE A MAJORITY INDIAN PARTNER AND ALL PRODUCTS HAVE TO BE MADE IN INDIA 
Kannada-0039-3936	THIS SEEMS LIKE A LEAF OUT OF INDIAS RETAIL FDI POLICY THAT HAS SIMILAR PROCUREMENT DIKTATS THAT ARE NOT EASY TO MEET OR MONITOR 
Kannada-0039-3937	ETAILER COSTS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO RISE ON ACCOUNT OF PROPOSED NORMS ON STORING AND PROCESSING DATA LOCALLY
Kannada-0039-3938	WHILE CONSUMERS AND FIRMS COULD BOTH QUESTION THE PLAN TO STIPULATE PAYMENTS VIA RUPAY CARDS 
Kannada-0039-3939	THE PROPOSED ECOMMERCE POLICY COULD DRIVE AWAY THOSE PLANNING ONLINE RETAIL FORAYS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE JOBS AND BENEFIT CONSUMERS WOULD BE LOST
Kannada-0039-3940	THE LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION ACT TO GIVE STATES THE POWER TO DETAIN STUDENTS WHO FAIL AN EXAMINATION IN CLASS FIVE OR EIGHT IS A NEGATIVE MEASURE 
Kannada-0039-3941	ALTHOUGH MANY STATES WANT SUCH A CHANGE THE AMENDMENT PASSED BY THE LOK SABHA GOES AGAINST THE VIEW OF MANY EDUCATIONISTS 
Kannada-0039-3942	WHO ARGUE THAT IT WOULD WEAKEN ONE OF THE PROGRESSIVE FEATURES OF THE RTE ACT WHICH IS TO GUARANTEE THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THE CHILD IN SCHOOL DURING THE FORMATIVE LEARNING PHASE
Kannada-0039-3943	THE PROPOSED CHANGE WILL ALLOW STATE BOARDS TO DECLARE A STUDENT FAILED AND DETAIN HER ON THE BASIS OF AN EXAMINATION
Kannada-0039-3944	ALTHOUGH SECTION THIRTY OF THE RTE ACT HOLDS OUT THE ASSURANCE THAT NO CHILD SHALL BE REQUIRED TO FACE ANY BOARD EXAMINATION TILL COMPLETION OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Kannada-0039-3945	THERE ARE GENUINE CONCERNS ON LEARNING OUTCOMES PRODUCED BY INDIAS SCHOOLING SYSTEM 
Kannada-0039-3946	BUT THESE ARE DETERMINED NOT ONLY BY A STUDENTS EFFORT BUT ALSO BY THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF TEACHERS
Kannada-0039-3947	PROCESSES FOR CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT AND CRUCIALLY ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF PARENTS AND THE COMMUNITY IN ENCOURAGING EXCELLENCE 
Kannada-0039-3948	IT IS THE LACK OF ATTENTION TO SOME OF THESE DETERMINANTS THAT HAS CREATED WHAT HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT MINISTER PRAKASH JAVADEKAR CALLS A BROKEN SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM
Kannada-0039-3949	THE ENGLISHMAN COMPARED WITH PRIDE HIS OWN FIELDS WITH THE DESOLATE BOGS WHENCE THE RAPPAREES ISSUED FORTH TO ROB AND MURDER 
Kannada-0039-3950	AND HIS OWN DWELLING WITH THE HOVELS WHERE THE PEASANTS AND THE HOGS OF THE SHANNON WALLOWED IN FILTH TOGETHER 
Kannada-0039-3951	HE WAS A MEMBER OF A SOCIETY FAR INFERIOR INDEED IN WEALTH AND CIVILISATION TO THE SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE 
Kannada-0039-3952	BUT STILL ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST HIGHLY CIVILISED SOCIETIES THAT THE WORLD HAD THEN SEEN THE IRISH WERE ALMOST AS RUDE AS THE SAVAGES OF LABRADOR 
Kannada-0039-3953	HE WAS A FREEMAN THE IRISH WERE THE HEREDITARY SERFS OF HIS RACE HE WORSHIPPED GOD AFTER A PURE AND RATIONAL FASHION 
Kannada-0039-3954	THE IRISH WERE SUNK IN IDOLATRY AND SUPERSTITION HE KNEW THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF IRISH HAD REPEATEDLY FLED BEFORE A SMALL ENGLISH FORCE 
Kannada-0039-3955	AND THAT THE WHOLE IRISH POPULATION HAD BEEN HELD DOWN BY A SMALL ENGLISH COLONY AND HE VERY COMPLACENTLY INFERRED THAT HE WAS NATURALLY A BEING OF A HIGHER ORDER THAN THE IRISHMAN
Kannada-0039-3956	FOR IT IS THUS THAT A DOMINANT RACE ALWAYS EXPLAINS ITS ASCENDENCY AND EXCUSES ITS TYRANNY
Kannada-0039-3957	THAT IN VIVACITY HUMOUR AND ELOQUENCE THE IRISH STAND HIGH AMONG THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD IS NOW UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
Kannada-0039-3958	THAT WHEN WELL DISCIPLINED THEY ARE EXCELLENT SOLDIERS HAS BEEN PROVED ON A HUNDRED FIELDS OF BATTLE 
Kannada-0039-3959	YET IT IS CERTAIN THAT A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THEY WERE GENERALLY DESPISED IN OUR ISLAND AS BOTH A STUPID AND A COWARDLY PEOPLE 
Kannada-0039-3960	AND THESE WERE THE MEN WHO WERE TO HOLD ENGLAND DOWN BY MAIN FORCE WHILE HER CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL CONSTITUTION WAS DESTROYED 
Kannada-0039-3961	THE BLOOD OF THE WHOLE NATION BOILED AT THE THOUGHT TO BE CONQUERED BY FRENCHMEN OR BY SPANIARDS WOULD HAVE SEEMED COMPARATIVELY A TOLERABLE FATE 
Kannada-0039-3962	WITH FRENCHMEN AND SPANIARDS WE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO TREAT ON EQUAL TERMS 
Kannada-0039-3963	WE HAD SOMETIMES ENVIED THEIR PROSPERITY SOMETIMES DREADED THEIR POWER SOMETIMES CONGRATULATED OURSELVES ON THEIR FRIENDSHIP 
Kannada-0039-3964	IN SPITE OF OUR UNSOCIAL PRIDE WE ADMITTED THAT THEY WERE GREAT NATIONS AND THAT THEY COULD BOAST OF MEN EMINENT IN THE ARTS OF WAR AND PEACE

Kannada-0040-3966	THE CASE TO REPLACE THE NODETENTION PROVISION WITH ONE THAT REINTRODUCES EXAMINATIONS IN GRADES THIRD FIFTH AND EIGHTH WAS MADE BY A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL ADVISORY BOARD OF EDUCATION
Kannada-0040-3967	FOR ONE IT CONCLUDED THAT THE CRUCIAL GUARANTEE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED ONLY UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS 
Kannada-0040-3968	AND THESE WERE NOT AVAILABLE WHILE THE PIONEERING RTE ACT WANTED TO EXTEND IT TO ALL GRADES WITHIN ITS PURVIEW 
Kannada-0040-3969	YET THE PROVISION IS CENTRAL TO THE OBJECTS OF THE LAW SINCE IT SEEKS TO CHECK DROPOUTS AND ENABLE ALL CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL IN ORDER TO DERIVE BENEFITS THAT GO BEYOND ROTELEARNING
Kannada-0040-3970	IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NITI AAYOG FOUND BASED ON A STUDY IN PUNJAB THAT BRINGING BACK DETENTION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLING WOULD INCREASE THE DROPOUT RATE
Kannada-0040-3971	IMPACTING THE POOR AND DALITS THE MOST AS THEY DEPENDED ON GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS 
Kannada-0040-3972	BESIDES THE PROPOSED CURE MAY MAKE ANOTHER PROBLEM WORSE WHEN PARENTS ARE UNABLE TO ENSURE REGULAR ATTENDANCE OF CHILDREN DUE TO SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
Kannada-0040-3973	IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT DETAINING THEM FOR NONPERFORMANCE WILL ACT AS AN INCENTIVE TO ATTEND SCHOOL REGULARLY 
Kannada-0040-3974	THE MOVE TO INTRODUCE EXAMINATIONS AS FILTERS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY THOUGHT THROUGH
Kannada-0040-3975	AND MAY BE A HASTY RESPONSE TO DEMANDS FROM STATE GOVERNMENTS WHICH WANT TO BE SEEN AS ACTING FIRMLY IN FAVOUR OF QUALITY 
Kannada-0040-3976	TINKERING WITH THE RTE ACT WITHOUT SUFFICIENT THOUGHT WILL ERODE A MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL ACHIEVEMENT
Kannada-0040-3977	WHEN THE CONGRESSS NEWLY RECONSTITUTED WORKING COMMITTEE WHICH MET FOR THE FIRST TIME ON JULY TWENTY SECOND
Kannada-0040-3978	THEY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO PITCH RAHUL GANDHI AS THE OPPOSITIONS PRIME MINISTERIAL FACE
Kannada-0040-3979	IT GOT A REALITY CHECK FROM ONE OF ITS MOST STEADFAST ALLIES THE RASHTRIYA JANATA DAL  
Kannada-0040-3980	THE RJD SCION TEJASHWI YADAV DECLARED THAT OPPOSITION PARTIES WILL DECIDE ON THIS COLLECTIVELY
Kannada-0040-3981	SHORTLY AFTER MR YADAVS STATEMENT THE CONGRESS TOO CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT AVERSE TO ANYONE ELSE BECOMING PRIME MINISTER
Kannada-0040-3982	THIS MARKS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR OPPOSITION UNITY
Kannada-0040-3983	THERE ARE TWO STREAMS OF OPINION ON OPPOSITION UNITY THE OPTIMISTS AND THE SCEPTICS 
Kannada-0040-3984	THE OPTIMISTS BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE IMMINENT DANGER OF INDIA BECOMING A HINDU RASHTRA WHERE THE SPACE FOR DEMOCRATIC POLITICS WOULD BE ALL BUT EXTINGUISHED
Kannada-0040-3985	OPPOSITION UNITY IS INEVITABLE BECAUSE IT IS A MATTER OF POLITICAL SURVIVAL FOR EVERY PARTY THAT IS NOT THE BJP
Kannada-0040-3986	THE SCEPTICS HOWEVER ARE CONVINCED THAT ATTEMPTS AT OPPOSITION UNITY ARE DOOMED TO COLLAPSE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF POLITICAL CONTRADICTIONS AND COLLIDING AMBITIONS 
Kannada-0040-3987	WHATS MORE THE WEAKEST LINK OF ANY SUCH ANTIBJP FRONT THEY POINT OUT WOULD BE THE CONGRESS ITSELF
Kannada-0040-3988	WHICH HAS SO FAR FAILED TO OFFER A MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVE TO THE IDEOLOGICAL CHALLENGE POSED BY THE BJP
Kannada-0040-3989	THE SCEPTICS HAVE A POINT OPPOSITION UNITY AS AN ELECTORAL TACTIC MAY WORK UP TO A POINT 
Kannada-0040-3990	THE NAVY AND ARMY WERE THEREFORE FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO REPEL A DUTCH INVASION 
Kannada-0040-3991	BUT COULD THE NAVY COULD THE ARMY BE TRUSTED WOULD NOT THE TRAINBANDS FLOCK BY THOUSANDS TO THE STANDARD OF THE DELIVERER 
Kannada-0040-3992	THE PARTY WHICH HAD A FEW YEARS BEFORE DRAWN THE SWORD FOR MONMOUTH WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE EAGER TO WELCOME THE PRINCE OF ORANGE 
Kannada-0040-3993	AND WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PARTY WHICH HAD DURING SEVEN AND FORTY YEARS BEEN THE BULWARK OF MONARCHY 
Kannada-0040-3994	WHERE WERE NOW THOSE GALLANT GENTLEMEN WHO HAD EVER BEEN READY TO SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR THE CROWN 
Kannada-0040-3995	OUTRAGED AND INSULTED DRIVEN FROM THE BENCH OF JUSTICE AND DEPRIVED OF ALL MILITARY COMMAND THEY SAW THE PERIL OF THEIR UNGRATEFUL SOVEREIGN WITH UNDISGUISED DELIGHT 
Kannada-0040-3996	WHERE WERE THOSE PRIESTS AND PRELATES WHO HAD FROM TEN THOUSAND PULPITS PROCLAIMED THE DUTY OF OBEYING THE ANOINTED DELEGATE OF GOD 
Kannada-0040-3997	SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN IMPRISONED SOME HAD BEEN PLUNDERED ALL HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER THE IRON RULE OF THE HIGH COMMISSION 
Kannada-0040-3998	AND HAD BEEN IN HOURLY FEAR LEST SOME NEW FREAK OF TYRANNY SHOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR FREEHOLDS AND LEAVE THEM WITHOUT A MORSEL OF BREAD 
Kannada-0040-3999	THAT CHURCHMEN WOULD EVEN NOW SO COMPLETELY FORGET THE DOCTRINE WHICH HAD BEEN THEIR PECULIAR BOAST AS TO JOIN IN ACTIVE RESISTANCE SEEMED INCREDIBLE 
Kannada-0040-4000	BUT COULD THEIR OPPRESSOR EXPECT TO FIND AMONG THEM THE SPIRIT WHICH IN THE PRECEDING GENERATION HAD TRIUMPHED OVER THE ARMIES OF ESSEX AND WALLER 
Kannada-0040-4001	AND HAD YIELDED ONLY AFTER A DESPERATE STRUGGLE TO THE GENIUS AND VIGOUR OF CROMWELL 
Kannada-0040-4002	THE TYRANT WAS OVERCOME BY FEAR HE CEASED TO REPEAT THAT CONCESSION HAD ALWAYS RUINED PRINCES AND SULLENLY OWNED THAT HE MUST STOOP TO COURT THE TORIES ONCE MORE

Kannada-0043-4086	BUT HE DEFIED SIMPLE APPRAISALS MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE 
Kannada-0043-4087	TO READ NAIPAUL TO LISTEN TO HIM TO FOLLOW HIS LIFE STORY WAS TO BE PERPETUALLY NUDGED TO REASSESS NOT JUST HIM BUT ALSO HIS SUBJECT MATTER AND ONES OWN VIEW OF THE WORLD 
Kannada-0043-4088	HE ONCE SAID ALL MY WORK IS REALLY ONE I AM WRITING ONE BIG BOOK 
Kannada-0043-4089	IN THAT BIG BOOK HE KEPT PUSHING BACK THE CHRONOLOGICAL BEGINNINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW COLONIALISM AND MIGRATION SHAPED THE MODERN WORLD
Kannada-0043-4090	AND TRAVELLING EVER WIDER TO EXAMINE HOW POSTCOLONIAL SOCIETIES SHAPESHIFTED 
Kannada-0043-4091	IT WAS AN ENDEAVOUR THAT STARTED AND NEVER VEERED TOO FAR FROM HIS OWN BIOGRAPHY 
Kannada-0043-4092	BORN IN TRINIDAD TO PARENTS OF INDIAN ORIGIN WHOSE FOREBEARS HAD COME TO THE WEST INDIES AS INDENTURED LABOUR NAIPAUL WAS CONSUMED BY ONE AMBITION TO BE A WRITER 
Kannada-0043-4093	IT WAS IN LARGE MEASURE ACQUIRED FROM HIS FATHER A JOURNALIST IN PORT OF SPAIN STRUGGLING WITH THE NEEDS

Kannada-0043-4097	IT WAS NAIPAULS TRAVELS HOWEVER THAT SPANNED THE GREATER PART OF HIS WRITING LIFE AS HE CRAFTED HIS OWN WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD 
Kannada-0043-4098	HE SAID IN HIS NOBEL LECTURE THAT AS A CHILD IN TRINIDAD HE FELT HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY AREAS OF DARKNESS AND THESE BECAME HIS SUBJECTS 
Kannada-0043-4099	HE TRAVELLED ACROSS CONTINENTS ALWAYS WITH A THEME IN MIND 
Kannada-0043-4100	HE OPENED UP LINES OF INQUIRY ON IDENTITY AND PROGRESS 
Kannada-0043-4101	HIS UNSPARING EYE AND SPARE CLEAR PROSE ENSURED THAT READERS COULD NOT UNSEE WHAT HE SAW WHETHER THEY WERE IN AGREEMENT OR NOT 
Kannada-0043-4102	HE WAS CRITICISED FOR DEPICTING THE DEVELOPING WORLD THROUGH AN IMPERIAL FILTER 
Kannada-0043-4103	HE WAS ACCUSED OF ISLAMOPHOBIA IN HIS TRAVELS IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES HE RAISED HACKLES WITH HIS INDIA TRILOGY AN AREA OF DARKNESS  A WOUNDED CIVILISATION  A MILLION MUTINIES NOW 
Kannada-0043-4104	BUT HE PRESCIENTLY BOOKMARKED THE DEBATES THAT COMING EVENTS WOULD SPARK 
Kannada-0043-4105	THERE WAS DEFINITELY LOWGRADE BIGOTRY AT PLAY AND MISOGYNY TOO

Kannada-0043-4107	THE CURTAINS CAME DOWN ON PAKISTANS ELECTION CAMPAIGN ON MONDAY AHEAD OF VOTING ON WEDNESDAY

Kannada-0043-4109	AND DARKENED BY THE LENGTHENING SHADOW OF THE MILITARY AND JUDICIAL ESTABLISHMENT 
Kannada-0043-4110	IT WAS A TERRIBLE MOMENT THE KING WAS GONE THE PRINCE HAD NOT ARRIVED 
Kannada-0043-4111	NO REGENCY HAD BEEN APPOINTED THE GREAT SEAL ESSENTIAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF ORDINARY JUSTICE HAD DISAPPEARED

Kannada-0044-4125	FOR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN PAKISTAN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UPHOLDING DEMOCRACY HANGS HEAVY 
Kannada-0044-4126	THEY HAVE BRAVED ELECTION RALLIES AS TERROR GROUPS KILLED DOZENS OF LEADERS AND SUPPORTERS INDISCRIMINATELY 
Kannada-0044-4127	EVEN AS THE MONTHLONG CAMPAIGN CAME TO A CLOSE A CANDIDATE OF THE PAKISTAN TEHREEKEINSAF WAS KILLED IN DERA ISMAIL KHAN IN A SUICIDE BOMBING
Kannada-0044-4128	EARLIER THIS MONTH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTY FIVEPEOPLE WERE KILLED AT A RALLY IN ONE SINGLE ATTACK IN BALOCHISTAN
Kannada-0044-4129	WHILE A SUICIDE BOMB ATTACK IN PESHAWAR KILLED THE POPULAR LEADER OF THE AWAMI NATIONAL PARTY HAROON BILOUR 
Kannada-0044-4130	THE CHOICE BEFORE VOTERS HAS ALSO NARROWED FORMER PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF AND SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED FROM THE ELECTION PROCESS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
Kannada-0044-4131	A MOVE THAT IS SEEN NOT SO MUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF THE NATURAL PROCESS OF JUSTICE BUT OF THE GROWING CIVILMILITARY DIVIDE 
Kannada-0044-4132	POLLS PUT PTI CHIEF AND FORMER CRICKETER IMRAN KHAN SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF MR SHARIFS SUCCESSOR AT THE HELM OF THE PAKISTAN MUSLIM LEAGUE
Kannada-0044-4133	HIS BROTHER SHAHBAZ SHARIF BUT MR KHAN ALSO FACES AN EMBARRASSING CONTROVERSY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FORMER WIFES TELLALL BOOK THAT PORTRAYS HIM AS UNSTABLE AND DISSOLUTE 
Kannada-0044-4134	THERE WERE SOME WORRIES THAT EVEN THE THIRD CONTENDER PAKISTAN PEOPLES PARTY COCHAIRMAN BILAWAL BHUTTO AND HIS FATHER
Kannada-0044-4135	FORMER PRESIDENT ASIF ALI ZARDARI COULD BE DISQUALIFIED OVER ELECTORAL MISDEMEANOURS 
Kannada-0044-4136	THE MOOD AHEAD OF THE ELECTIONS HAS BEEN FURTHER VITIATED BY THE RISE OF EXTREMIST AND SECTARIAN PARTIES INCLUDING ONE LED BY TWENTY SIX BY ELEVEN MUMBAI ATTACKS MASTERMIND HAFIZ SAEED 
Kannada-0044-4137	THESE GROUPS MAY ULTIMATELY NOT FARE WELL IN TERMS OF SEATS BUT THEY HAVE SPREAD PROJIHADI ANTIMINORITY POISON THROUGH PAKISTANS POLITY THAT NO POLITICAL PARTY HAS DARED TO CONTEST
Kannada-0044-4138	THE DAUNTING TASK FOR THE VOTER IS TO ELECT FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WILL DEAL WITH THE BIG CHALLENGES AHEAD
Kannada-0044-4139	TO STEADY AN ECONOMY BEING CRUSHED BY DEBT TO CHINA AND BY UN FINANCIAL STRICTURES TO BATTLE GROWING DIVIDES IN SOCIETY AND THE OVERWHELMING INFLUENCE OF TERROR GROUPS 
Kannada-0044-4140	TO REESTABLISH DISRUPTED TIES WITH NEIGHBOURS AND TO STAVE OFF THE INCREASING MILITARY INFLUENCE IN THE SMALL SPACE THAT THE CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH FOR ITSELF
Kannada-0044-4141	IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT PAKISTAN HAS A CANDIDATE OR PARTY THAT CAN HOPE TO DO ANY LET ALONE ALL OF THE ABOVE 
Kannada-0044-4142	THE VOTER MUST ALSO MAKE HER CHOICE UNDER UNUSUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE MEDIA 
Kannada-0044-4143	YET THE ONE REASON TO CELEBRATE THESE ELECTIONS IS THAT THEY ARE HAPPENING AT ALL
Kannada-0044-4144	MARKING ONLY THE SECOND CIVILIANTOCIVILIAN ELECTORAL TRANSFER IN PAKISTANS HISTORY
Kannada-0044-4145	REPORTS OF TRACES OF THE CHEMICAL FORMALDEHYDE IN FISH IN SEVERAL STATES HIGHLIGHT BOTH THE UNCERTAINTIES OF SCIENCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CLEAR RISKCOMMUNICATION 
Kannada-0044-4146	IN JUNE THE KERALA GOVERNMENT FOUND FORMALDEHYDELACED FISH BEING TRANSPORTED INTO THE STATE 
Kannada-0044-4147	SOON AFTER THE HINDU CARRIED OUT A JOINT INVESTIGATION WITH THE TAMIL NADU DR J JAYALALITHAA FISHERIES UNIVERSITY TO LOOK FOR FORMALDEHYDE IN CHENNAI 
Kannada-0044-4148	THE STUDY REVEALED AROUND FIVE TO TWENTY PPM OF THE CHEMICAL IN FRESHWATER AND MARINE FISH IN TWO OF THE CITYS MARKETS NEXT GOA REPORTED SIMILAR FINDINGS 
Kannada-0044-4149	BUT ITS FOOD AND DRUGS ADMINISTRATION LATER SAID THE LEVELS IN GOAN SAMPLES WERE ON A PAR WITH NATURALLY OCCURRING FORMALDEHYDE IN MARINE FISH 
Kannada-0044-4150	AT LONDON WILLIAM WAS IMPATIENTLY EXPECTED FOR IT WAS NOT DOUBTED THAT HIS VIGOUR AND ABILITY WOULD SPEEDILY RESTORE ORDER AND SECURITY 
Kannada-0044-4151	THERE WAS HOWEVER SOME DELAY FOR WHICH THE PRINCE CANNOT JUSTLY BE BLAMED 
Kannada-0044-4152	HIS ORIGINAL INTENTION HAD BEEN TO PROCEED FROM HUNGERFORD TO OXFORD WHERE HE WAS ASSURED OF AN HONOURABLE AND AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION 
Kannada-0044-4153	BUT THE ARRIVAL OF THE DEPUTATION FROM GUILDHALL INDUCED HIM TO CHANGE HIS INTENTION AND TO HASTEN DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE CAPITAL 
Kannada-0044-4154	ON THE WAY HE LEARNED THAT FEVERSHAM IN PURSUANCE OF THE KINGS ORDERS HAD DISMISSED THE ROYAL ARMY AND THAT THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS 
Kannada-0044-4155	FREED FROM RESTRAINT AND DESTITUTE OF NECESSARIES WERE SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTIES THROUGH WHICH THE ROAD TO LONDON LAY 
Kannada-0044-4156	IT WAS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE FOR WILLIAM TO PROCEED SLENDERLY ATTENDED WITHOUT GREAT DANGER NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN PERSON ABOUT WHICH HE WAS NOT MUCH IN THE HABIT OF BEING SOLICITOUS
Kannada-0044-4157	BUT ALSO TO THE GREAT INTERESTS WHICH WERE UNDER HIS CARE 
Kannada-0044-4158	IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD REGULATE HIS OWN MOVEMENTS BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS TROOPS 
Kannada-0044-4159	AND TROOPS COULD THEN MOVE BUT SLOWLY OVER THE HIGHWAYS OF ENGLAND IN MIDWINTER 
Kannada-0044-4160	HE WAS ON THIS OCCASION A LITTLE MOVED FROM HIS ORDINARY COMPOSURE I AM NOT TO BE THUS DEALT WITH HE EXCLAIMED WITH BITTERNESS 
Kannada-0044-4161	AND THAT MY LORD FEVERSHAM SHALL FIND PROMPT AND JUDICIOUS MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO REMEDY THE EVILS WHICH JAMES HAD CAUSED 
Kannada-0044-4162	CHURCHILL AND GRAFTON WERE ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF REASSEMBLING THE DISPERSED ARMY AND BRINGING IT INTO ORDER 
Kannada-0044-4163	THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS WERE INVITED TO RESUME THEIR MILITARY CHARACTER 
Kannada-0044-4164	THE IRISH WERE COMMANDED TO DELIVER UP THEIR ARMS ON PAIN OF BEING TREATED AS BANDITTI BUT WERE ASSURED THAT IF THEY WOULD SUBMIT QUIETLY THEY SHOULD BE SUPPLIED WITH NECESSARIES

Kannada-0045-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0045-4165	THIS TRIGGERED SUSPICIONS AMONG RESIDENTS WHO ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF PLAYING DOWN THE HEALTH RISK 
Kannada-0045-4166	THE FOOD SAFETY AND STANDARDS AUTHORITY OF INDIA HAS BANNED FORMALDEHYDE IN FRESH FISH
Kannada-0045-4167	WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER LABELLED THE CHEMICAL A CARCINOGEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR  
Kannada-0045-4168	THE EVIDENCE THE IARC RELIED ON MAINLY CONSISTS OF STUDIES ON WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PRINTING TEXTILES AND EMBALMING 
Kannada-0045-4169	SUCH WORKERS INHALE FORMALDEHYDE FUMES AND THE STUDIES SHOW HIGH RATES OF NASOPHARYNGEAL AND OTHER CANCERS AMONG THEM 
Kannada-0045-4170	BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT FORMALDEHYDE CAUSES CANCER WHEN INGESTED ORALLY 
Kannada-0045-4171	A NINETEEN NINETY STUDY BY US RESEARCHERS ESTIMATED THAT HUMANS CONSUME ELEVEN MG OF THE CHEMICAL THROUGH DIETARY SOURCES EVERY DAY
Kannada-0045-4172	IS FORMALIN PRESENT IN YOUR FISH HERES HOW TO BUY UNADULTERATED SEAFOOD
Kannada-0045-4173	SO WHY IS FORMALDEHYDE IN FISH A PROBLEM 
Kannada-0045-4174	FOR ONE THING FRESH FISH SHOULD NOT HAVE PRESERVATIVES AND THE PRESENCE OF FORMALDEHYDE POINTS TO UNSCRUPULOUS VENDORS TRYING TO PASS OFF STALE CATCH AS RECENT 
Kannada-0045-4175	TWO THE LACK OF EVIDENCE LINKING INGESTED FORMALDEHYDE WITH CANCER DOESNT NECESSARILY MAKE THE CHEMICAL SAFE 
Kannada-0045-4176	AT HIGH DOSES IT CAUSES GASTRIC IRRITATION 
Kannada-0045-4177	PLUS THE LACK OF DATA COULD MERELY MEAN THAT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING FORMALDEHYDE REGULARLY ENOUGH FOR ITS CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS TO SHOW
Kannada-0045-4178	THERE IS A THIRD COMPLICATION WHEN CERTAIN MARINE FISH ARE IMPROPERLY FROZEN DURING TRANSIT FORMALDEHYDE FORMS IN THEM NATURALLY 
Kannada-0045-4179	BUT THIS FORMALDEHYDE BINDS TO THE TISSUE UNLIKE ADDED FORMALDEHYDE WHICH REMAINS FREE
Kannada-0045-4180	AND SO MEASURING FREE FORMALDEHYDE VERSUS BOUND FORMALDEHYDE CAN BE ONE WAY OF DISTINGUISHING A CONTAMINANT FROM A NATURALLY OCCURRING CHEMICAL 
Kannada-0045-4181	IN THIS CONTEXT THE GOAN GOVERNMENT MUST CLARIFY ITS CLAIM DID THE GOAN FDA MEASURE FREE FORMALDEHYDE OR BOUND FORMALDEHYDE 
Kannada-0045-4182	IF IT MEASURED THE SUM OF BOTH ON WHAT BASIS DID IT CONCLUDE THAT THE CHEMICAL CAME FROM NATURAL SOURCES 
Kannada-0045-4183	SOME FORMALDEHYDE CONSUMPTION MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE FOR FISH LOVERS AND IT MAY NOT BE A HEALTH RISK EITHER 
Kannada-0045-4184	BUT THE LINE BETWEEN SAFE AND UNSAFE CONSUMPTION SHOULD BE DRAWN BY EXPERTS IN A TRANSPARENT MANNER 
Kannada-0045-4185	THE GOAN CLAIM DOESNT MEET THIS CRITERION THIS IS WHY INSTEAD OF ALLAYING THE FEARS OF CONSUMERS IT IS STOKING THEM
Kannada-0045-4186	ANNIVERSARIES CAN BE REASONS TO CELEBRATE THE PRESENT OR REMINISCE ABOUT OUR PAST 
Kannada-0045-4187	WHEN WE DO THE LATTER IT IS A CALL TO MEMORY OFTEN SIGNIFYING AN UNFULFILLED PROMISE AND A PREFERENCE FOR NOSTALGIA 
Kannada-0045-4188	AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH WILL MARK THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNANIMOUS AFFIRMATION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY BY A NINEJUDGE BENCH OF THE SUPREME COURT 
Kannada-0045-4189	THE COURT IMPOSED UPON THE GOVERNMENT A CLEAR OBLIGATION TO MAKE A LAW SAFEGUARDING A PERSONS INFORMATIONAL PRIVACY COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS DATA PROTECTION 
Kannada-0045-4190	AT LENGTH THE PRISONERS WERE PUT ON SHORE AND CARRIED TO AN INN A CROWD HAD ASSEMBLED THERE TO SEE THEM 
Kannada-0045-4191	AND JAMES THOUGH DISGUISED BY A WIG OF DIFFERENT SHAPE AND COLOUR FROM THAT WHICH HE USUALLY WORE WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED 
Kannada-0045-4192	FOR A MOMENT THE RABBLE SEEMED TO BE OVERAWED BUT THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR CHIEFS REVIVED THEIR COURAGE AND THE SIGHT OF HALES WHOM THEY WELL KNEW AND BITTERLY HATED INFLAMED THEIR FURY 
Kannada-0045-4193	HIS PARK WAS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT A BAND OF RIOTERS WAS EMPLOYED IN PILLAGING HIS HOUSE AND SHOOTING HIS DEER 
Kannada-0045-4194	THE MULTITUDE ASSURED THE KING THAT THEY WOULD NOT HURT HIM BUT THEY REFUSED TO LET HIM DEPART 
Kannada-0045-4195	IT CHANCED THAT THE EARL OF WINTER A PROTESTANT BUT A ZEALOUS ROYALIST HEAD OF THE FINCH FAMILY AND A NEAR KINSMAN OF NOTTINGHAM WAS THEN AT CANTERBURY 
Kannada-0045-4196	AS SOON AS HE LEARNED WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE HASTENED TO THE COAST ACCOMPANIED BY SOME KENTISH GENTLEMEN 
Kannada-0045-4197	BY THEIR INTERVENTION THE KING WAS REMOVED TO A MORE CONVENIENT LODGING BUT HE WAS STILL A PRISONER 
Kannada-0045-4198	THE MOB KEPT CONSTANT WATCH ROUND THE HOUSE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CARRIED AND SOME OF THE RINGLEADERS LAY AT THE DOOR OF HIS BEDROOM 
Kannada-0045-4199	HIS DEMEANOUR MEANTIME WAS THAT OF A MAN ALL THE NERVES OF WHOSE MIND HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE LOAD OF MISFORTUNES 
Kannada-0045-4200	SOMETIMES HE SPOKE SO HAUGHTILY THAT THE RUSTICS WHO HAD CHARGE OF HIM WERE PROVOKED INTO MAKING INSOLENT REPLIES 
Kannada-0045-4201	THEN HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO SUPPLICATION LET ME GO HE CRIED GET ME A BOAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE IS HUNTING FOR MY LIFE 
Kannada-0045-4202	IF YOU DO NOT LET ME FLY NOW IT WILL BE TOO LATE MY BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEADS HE THAT IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME ON THIS LAST TEXT HE PREACHED A SERMON HALF AN HOUR LONG 
Kannada-0045-4203	HE HARANGUED ON A STRANGE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS ON THE DISOBEDIENCE OF THE FELLOWS OF MELLON COLLEGE ON THE MIRACLES WROUGHT BY SAINT WINIFREDS WELL 
Kannada-0045-4204	ON THE DISLOYALTY OF THE BLACK COATS AND ON THE VIRTUES OF A PIECE OF THE TRUE CROSS WHICH HE HAD UNFORTUNATELY LOST WHAT HAVE I DONE HE DEMANDED OF THE KENTISH SQUIRES WHO ATTENDED HIM
Kannada-0045-4205	TELL ME THE TRUTH WHAT ERROR HAVE I COMMITTED 
Kannada-0045-4206	THOSE TO WHOM HE PUT THESE QUESTIONS WERE TOO HUMANE TO RETURN THE ANSWER WHICH MUST HAVE RISEN TO THEIR LIPS AND LISTENED TO HIS WILD TALK IN PITYING SILENCE

Kannada-0046-4207	THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT WHICH HAD SIX SEPARATE OPINIONS THAT CONVERGE INTO A UNANIMOUS DECISION NOTED IN THE WORDS OF JUSTICE CHANDRACHUD AND JUSTICE KAUL
Kannada-0046-4208	THAT THE UNION GOVERNMENT HAD TASKED A COMMITTEE HEADED BY JUSTICE BN SRIKRISHNA TO FORMULATE SUCH A LAW IN JULY LAST YEAR 
Kannada-0046-4209	THIS COMMITTEE HAS PRODUCED A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT RUN INTO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN PAGES AND A DRAFT LAW TITLED THE THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION BILL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RUNNING INTO ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE SECTIONS 
Kannada-0046-4210	DESPITE BEING FORMED WITHIN THE AMBIT OF AND EVEN BEING BOUND BY THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT
Kannada-0046-4211	THE RECOMMENDATIONS DO NOT ONLY UNDERMINE THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES WITHIN IT BUT ALSO REINTERPRET THEM
Kannada-0046-4212	WHILE THIS CLAIM MAY SEEM PROVOCATIVE IT IS BASED ON A READING OF THE PRIVACY JUDGMENT
Kannada-0046-4213	FIRST IT EXPRESSLY STATED THE PRIMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AS THE BENEFICIARY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 
Kannada-0046-4214	SECOND IT REJECTED THE ARGUMENT THAT THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY DISSOLVES IN THE FACE OF AMORPHOUS COLLECTIVE NOTIONS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
Kannada-0046-4215	THE PRIORITIES OF THE SRIKRISHNA COMMITTEE STRAY FROM THESE TWO BASIC POINTS 
Kannada-0046-4216	ITS REPORT TITLED A FREE AND FAIR DIGITAL ECONOMY PROTECTING PRIVACY EMPOWERING INDIANS KEEPS TO THE APPARENT PECKING ORDER THAT ITS TITLE SIGNALS
Kannada-0046-4217	THE COMMON GOOD AND THE ECONOMY COME FIRST AND INDIVIDUALS SECOND 
Kannada-0046-4218	IN JUSTIFYING THIS FRAMEWORK THE REPORT RUNS INTO TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES AS IT ATTEMPTS TO PUT TOGETHER A REGULATORY AGENDA
Kannada-0046-4219	THAT RECONCILES THE EXPANSION OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND STATE CONTROL WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT
Kannada-0046-4220	THESE DIFFICULTIES REVEAL THEMSELVES IN A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 
Kannada-0046-4221	THESE ARE MADE ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW BY THE HEAVY USE OF JARGON AND A RELIANCE ON FOREIGN AND ACADEMIC AUTHORITIES WHICH ARE OFTEN CITED WITHOUT PROPER CONTEXT 
Kannada-0046-4222	THE TROUBLE BEGINS WITH THE REPORTS CONCEPTION OF THE STATE THE STATES PURPOSE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE REPORT IS BASED ON TWO PLANKS 
Kannada-0046-4223	FIRST AND FOREMOST THE STATE IS A FACILITATOR OF HUMAN PROGRESS AND IS COMMANDED BY THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY TO SERVE THE COMMON GOOD 
Kannada-0046-4224	HERE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WHICH HELP PROTECT AGAINST A STATE PRONE TO EXCESS COME SECOND 
Kannada-0046-4225	THIS IGNORES THE VERY STRUCTURE OF THE CONSTITUTION IN WHICH THE CHAPTER GUARANTEEING ENFORCEABLE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS STANDS ON ITS OWN
Kannada-0046-4226	PRECEDING THE ONE SETTING OUT UNENFORCEABLE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY
Kannada-0046-4227	IN DOING THE SO THE REPORT ATTEMPTS TO OPEN THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY TO ALLOW THE STATE THE MOST CONVENIENT MEANS BY WHICH TO REALISE ITS REGULATORY AGENDA 
Kannada-0046-4228	ENABLING THE GOVERNMENTS CONVENIENCE IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE LAID OUT BY THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT 
Kannada-0046-4229	CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF RIGHTS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY BEND EVEN TO THE PURSUIT OF CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGITIMATE AIMS 
Kannada-0046-4230	INSTEAD A RIGOROUS THREEPART TEST SET OUT IN THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT MAKES CLEAR THAT IT IS FOR THE GOVERNMENT
Kannada-0046-4231	TO MEASURE AND JUSTIFY ITS ACTIONS AT EVERY POINT THAT IT SEEKS TO MAKE INROADS INTO OUR PRIVACYT
Kannada-0046-4232	BUT IT WAS TOO LATE JAMES WAS ALREADY IN LONDON HE HAD HESITATED ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND HAD AT ONE TIME DETERMINED TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO REACH THE CONTINENT 
Kannada-0046-4233	BUT AT LENGTH HE YIELDED TO THE URGENCY OF FRIENDS WHO WERE WISER THAN HIMSELF AND SET OUT FOR WHITEHALL 
Kannada-0046-4234	HE ARRIVED THERE ON THE AFTERNOON OF SUNDAY THE SIXTEENTH OF DECEMBER 
Kannada-0046-4235	HE HAD BEEN APPREHENSIVE THAT THE COMMON PEOPLE WHO DURING HIS ABSENCE HAD GIVEN SO MANY PROOFS OF THEIR AVERSION TO POPERY WOULD OFFER HIM SOME AFFRONT 
Kannada-0046-4236	BUT THE VERY VIOLENCE OF THE RECENT OUTBREAK HAD PRODUCED A REMISSION THE STORM HAD SPENT ITSELF GOOD HUMOUR AND PITY HAD SUCCEEDED TO FURY 
Kannada-0046-4237	IN NO QUARTER WAS ANY DISPOSITION SHOWN TO INSULT THE KING SOME CHEERS WERE RAISED AS HIS COACH PASSED THROUGH THE CITY 
Kannada-0046-4238	THE BELLS OF SOME CHURCHES WERE RUNG AND A FEW BONFIRES WERE LIGHTED IN HONOUR OF HIS RETURN 
Kannada-0046-4239	HIS FEEBLE MIND WHICH HAD JUST BEFORE BEEN SUNK IN DESPONDENCY WAS EXTRAVAGANTLY ELATED BY THESE UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF POPULAR GOODWILL AND COMPASSION 
Kannada-0046-4240	HE ENTERED HIS DWELLING IN HIGH SPIRITS IT SPEEDILY RESUMED ITS OLD ASPECT ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO HAD DURING THE PRECEDING WEEK 
Kannada-0046-4241	BEEN GLAD TO HIDE THEMSELVES FROM THE RAGE OF THE MULTITUDE IN VAULTS AND COCKLOFTS NOW CAME FORTH FROM THEIR LURKING PLACES AND DEMANDED POSSESSION OF THEIR OLD APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE 
Kannada-0046-4242	GRACE WAS SAID AT THE ROYAL TABLE BY A JESUIT THE IRISH BROGUE THEN THE MOST HATEFUL OF ALL SOUNDS TO ENGLISH EARS WAS HEARD EVERYWHERE IN THE COURTS AND GALLERIES 
Kannada-0046-4243	THE KING HIMSELF HAD RESUMED ALL HIS OLD HAUGHTINESS HE HELD A COUNCIL HIS LAST COUNCIL AND EVEN IN THAT EXTREMITY SUMMONED TO THE BOARD PERSONS NOT LEGALLY QUALIFIED TO SIT THERE 
Kannada-0046-4244	HE EXPRESSED HIGH DISPLEASURE AT THE CONDUCT OF THOSE LORDS WHO DURING HIS ABSENCE HAD DARED TO TAKE THE ADMINISTRATION ON THEMSELVES 
Kannada-0046-4245	IT WAS THEIR DUTY HE CONCEIVED TO LET SOCIETY BE DISSOLVED TO LET THE HOUSES OF AMBASSADORS BE PULLED DOWN TO LET LONDON BE SET ON FIRE RATHER THAN ASSUME THE FUNCTIONS WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT FIT TO ABANDON 
Kannada-0046-4246	AMONG THOSE WHOM HE THUS CENSURED WERE SOME NOBLES AND PRELATES WHO IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ERRORS HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY TRUE TO HIM 
Kannada-0046-4247	AND WHO EVEN AFTER THIS PROVOCATION NEVER COULD BE INDUCED BY HOPE OR FEAR TO TRANSFER THEIR ALLEGIANCE FROM HIM TO ANY OTHER SOVEREIGN

Kannada-0047-4252	RIGHTS OF WHICH THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS AN EXAMPLE ARE NOT DEONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES THAT PROTECT INTERESTS OF ATOMISED INDIVIDUALS 
Kannada-0047-4253	THEN IT PROCEEDS TO CONCLUDE THUS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RIGHT ITSELF IS NOT BECAUSE IT TRANSLATES INTO AN INDIVIDUAL GOOD BE IT AUTONOMY SPEECH ETC

Kannada-0047-4255	MUCH OF THIS LANGUAGE IS INSCRUTABLE TO EVEN THE LEGALLY TRAINED MIND
Kannada-0047-4256	TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS IMPORT CAN BE MADE OUT THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE A STRAINED CONVOLUTED AND ULTIMATELY UNCONVINCING ATTEMPT

Kannada-0047-4263	IT IS THE REPORTS APPROACH TO RIGHTS THAT IS PERHAPS OF MOST CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY 
Kannada-0047-4264	ITS STATEMENT THAT RIGHTS ARE NOT DEONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS BOTH UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED IN ITS WORDING AND PATENTLY UNTRUE IN ITS CONTENT

Kannada-0047-4268	ARE ALL ESSENTIAL FACETS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING AND ARE HELD UP BY THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY WITH REGARD TO INFORMATION ABOUT US 
Kannada-0047-4269	IN STATING THAT RIGHTS ARE NOT THINGS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL IN THEMSELVES IS AN UNACCEPTABLE POSITION TO TAKE UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION 
Kannada-0047-4270	IN FACT IN THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY JUDGMENT JUSTICE KAUL APPROVES OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT LIBERTY
Kannada-0047-4271	IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT NINE JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT ASSEMBLE AND PRONOUNCE A UNANIMOUS JUDGMENT WITHOUT DISSENT 
Kannada-0047-4272	THE PROMISE OF SUCH A HOLDING BECOMES MORE CRITICAL WHEN IT CONCERNS THE LIBERTY OF INDIVIDUALS AND AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT AN IMBALANCE OF POWER WHICH EXISTS AGAINST THEM 
Kannada-0047-4273	THE ADVICE WAS GOOD BUT JAMES WAS IN NO CONDITION TO TAKE IT HIS UNDERSTANDING HAD ALWAYS BEEN DULL AND FEEBLE 
Kannada-0047-4274	AND SUCH AS IT WAS WOMANISH TREMORS AND CHILDISH FANCIES NOW DISABLED HIM FROM USING IT 
Kannada-0047-4275	HE WAS AWARE THAT HIS FLIGHT WAS THE THING WHICH HIS ADHERENTS MOST DREADED AND WHICH HIS ENEMIES MOST DESIRED 
Kannada-0047-4276	EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN SERIOUS PERSONAL RISK IN REMAINING THE OCCASION WAS ONE ON WHICH HE OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT IT INFAMOUS TO FLINCH 
Kannada-0047-4277	FOR THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER HE AND HIS POSTERITY SHOULD REIGN ON AN ANCESTRAL THRONE OR SHOULD BE VAGABONDS AND BEGGARS 
Kannada-0047-4278	BUT IN HIS MIND ALL OTHER FEELINGS HAD GIVEN PLACE TO A CRAVEN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE 
Kannada-0047-4279	TO THE EARNEST ENTREATIES AND UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENTS OF THE AGENTS WHOM HIS FRIENDS HAD SENT TO ROCHESTER HE HAD ONLY ONE ANSWER

Kannada-0051-4411	IT BEGAN THIS BY STOPPING THE BONUS OVER THE MSPS ANNOUNCED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS 
Kannada-0051-4412	OVER THE NEARLY FIVEYEAR PERIOD THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN MSP BY THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN LOWER THAN THE HIKE BY BOTH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS
Kannada-0051-4413	EVEN THIS GOVERNMENTS MUCHPUBLICISED RECENT HIKE IN MSP THIS YEAR IS LOWER THAN THE YEARONYEAR INCREASE ANNOUNCED BY THE UNITED PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE  
Kannada-0051-4414	THE MODI GOVERNMENTS FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THE MSP THAT IT ANNOUNCED FORCED THE FARMERS INTO DISTRESS SALE OF KHARIF AND RABI CROPS AMOUNTING TO AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSANDS CRORE RUPEES
Kannada-0051-4415	FOURTH THIS GOVERNMENT IS GUILTY OF PERHAPS THE MOST LACKADAISICAL RESPONSE TO NATIONWIDE DROUGHTS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEENFIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEENSIXTEEN 
Kannada-0051-4416	THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS RESPONSE WAS LIMITED TO A REVISION IN THE ELIGIBILITY CAP FOR COMPENSATION
Kannada-0051-4417	AND A ROUTINE RAISE IN THE COMPENSATION AMOUNT BUT ALSO INCLUDED CUTS IN CONTRIBUTION TO STATES FROM THE NATIONAL DISASTER RELIEF FUND 
Kannada-0051-4418	DESPITE REPEATED PUSH FROM THE SUPREME COURT THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT TAKE ANY PROACTIVE STEPS IN TERMS OF EITHER DECLARATION OF DROUGHT OR IMPROVEMENT IN RATION DELIVERY
Kannada-0051-4419	THE SUPREME COURT HAD TO REPRIMAND THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
Kannada-0051-4420	FIFTH THE MODI GOVERNMENTS LACK OF POLITICAL WILL IN IMPLEMENTING THE MAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE SCHEME HAS HIT THE RURAL POOR IN GENERAL AND FARM LABOURERS IN PARTICULAR 
Kannada-0051-4421	AFTER MAKING A DETERMINED BUT UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO DISMANTLE THE MGNREGS THE MODI GOVERNMENT HAS CHOKED THIS PROGRAMME OF ADEQUATE AND TIMELY FUNDS
Kannada-0051-4422	HE RENEGED ON ITS LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE TIMELY WAGES AND COMPENSATION FOR DELAYED PAYMENTS
Kannada-0051-4423	SIXTH FROM IMPOSING MINIMUM EXPORT PRICE ON POTATOES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO IMPORTING SUGAR FROM PAKISTAN THIS GOVERNMENT HAS FOLLOWED ANTIFARMER TRADE POLICIES 
Kannada-0051-4424	FARM EXPORTS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY DISCOURAGED LEADING TO A DECLINE IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS FROM FORTY THREE BILLION ON TWO THOUSAND THIRTEENFOURTEEN TO 33 BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEENSEVENTEEN 
Kannada-0051-4425	AT THE SAME TIME IMPORT OF LENTIL CHANA WHEAT SUGAR AND MILK POWDER WAS ALLOWED THAT LED TO A CRASH IN CROP PRICES
Kannada-0051-4426	A SUDDEN SHRINKING OF CASH LED TO DEMAND CONTRACTION AND FALL IN PRICES WHOSE EFFECTS ARE BEING FELT EVEN NOW
Kannada-0051-4427	EIGHTH THE GOVERNMENTS CRUDE ATTEMPT TO REGULATE LIVESTOCK MARKET BY IMPOSING BAN ON LIVESTOCK MOVEMENT AND ITS PROTECTION TO THOSE GUILTY OF LYNCHING
Kannada-0051-4428	THE SUSPECTED COW SMUGGLERS HAS DISRUPTED LIVESTOCK ECONOMIC CYCLE LEADING TO LOSS OF INCOME ON THE ONE HAND AND AGGRAVATION OF THE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM OF ANIMALS DESTROYING CROPS ON THE OTHER
Kannada-0051-4429	NINTH FOR THE ADIVASI FARMER THIS IS SURELY THE MOST INSENSITIVE GOVERNMENT 
Kannada-0051-4430	IN A SERIES OF MOVES THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DILUTED THE FOREST RIGHTS ACT AND VARIOUS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOREST CONSERVATION LAWS SUBSTANTIALLY
Kannada-0051-4431	IN ORDER TO HELP THE TRANSFER OF COMMON LAND AND WATER RESOURCES FROM THE ADIVASIS TO INDUSTRY
Kannada-0051-4432	AND FINALLY THE MODI GOVERNMENT MADE NOT ONE BUT FOUR ATTEMPTS TO BRING AN ORDINANCE SO AS TO NULLIFY THE HISTORIC LAND ACQUISITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN
Kannada-0051-4433	WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS HAD THE NEWS OF THIS GREAT REVOLUTION BEEN RECEIVED IN FRANCE
Kannada-0051-4434	THE POLITICS OF A LONG EVENTFUL AND GLORIOUS REIGN HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED IN A DAYENGLAND WAS AGAIN THE ENGLAND OF ELIZABETH AND OF CROMWELL 
Kannada-0051-4435	AND ALL THE RELATIONS OF ALL THE STATES OF CHRISTENDOM WERE COMPLETELY CHANGED BY THE SUDDEN INTRODUCTION OF THIS NEW POWER INTO THE SYSTEM 
Kannada-0051-4436	THE PARISIANS COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS PASSING IN LONDON 
Kannada-0051-4437	NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS FEELING IMPELLED THEM TO TAKE THE PART OF JAMESTHEY KNEW NOTHING OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION 
Kannada-0051-4438	THEY ABOMINATED THE ENGLISH CHURCH OUR REVOLUTION APPEARED TO THEM NOT AS THE TRIUMPH OF PUBLIC LIBERTY OVER DESPOTISM 
Kannada-0051-4439	BUT AS A FRIGHTFUL DOMESTIC TRAGEDY IN WHICH A VENERABLE AND PIOUS SERVIUS WAS HURLED FROM HIS THRONE BY A TARQUIN AND CRUSHED UNDER THE CHARIOT WHEELS OF A TULLIA 
Kannada-0051-4440	THEY CRIED SHAME ON THE TRAITOROUS CAPTAINS EXECRATED THE UNNATURAL DAUGHTERS AND REGARDED WILLIAM WITH A MORTAL LOATHING TEMPERED HOWEVER BY THE RESPECT WHICH VALOUR CAPACITY AND SUCCESS SELDOM FAIL TO INSPIRE 
Kannada-0051-4441	THE QUEEN EXPOSED TO THE NIGHT WIND AND RAIN WITH THE INFANT HEIR OF THREE CROWNS CLASPED TO HER BREAST 
Kannada-0051-4442	THE KING STOPPED ROBBED AND OUTRAGED BY RUFFIANS WERE OBJECTS OF PITY AND OF ROMANTIC INTEREST TO ALL FRANCE 
Kannada-0051-4443	BUT LEWIS SAW WITH PECULIAR EMOTION THE CALAMITIES OF THE HOUSE OF STUART ALL THE SELFISH AND ALL THE GENEROUS PARTS OF HIS NATURE WERE MOVED ALIKE 
Kannada-0051-4444	AFTER MANY YEARS OF PROSPERITY HE HAD AT LENGTH MET WITH A GREAT CHECK HE HAD RECKONED ON THE SUPPORT OR NEUTRALITY OF ENGLAND 
Kannada-0051-4445	HE HAD NOW NOTHING TO EXPECT FROM HER BUT ENERGETIC AND PERTINACIOUS HOSTILITY 
Kannada-0051-4446	A FEW WEEKS EARLIER HE MIGHT NOT UNREASONABLY HAVE HOPED TO SUBJUGATE FLANDERS AND TO GIVE LAW TO GERMANY 
Kannada-0051-4447	AT PRESENT HE MIGHT THINK HIMSELF FORTUNATE IF HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFEND HIS OWN FRONTIERS AGAINST A CONFEDERACY SUCH AS EUROPE HAD NOT SEEN DURING MANY AGES

Kannada-0052-0003	THE COMPANY WHICH RUNS RETAIL AUTOMOTIVE STORES TOLD SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISER TO TERMINATE DISCUSSIONS TO SELL THE FIRM 
Kannada-0052-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0052-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0052-4448	AND TAKE AWAY THE FEW CONCESSIONS THAT FARMERS HAD WON AFTER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS 
Kannada-0052-4449	FURTHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS EFFECTIVELY BYPASSED THIS LAW IN THE LAND ACQUISITIONS DONE BY CENTRAL AGENCIES LIKE THE NATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA
Kannada-0052-4450	THEY ALSO ALLOWED STATE GOVERNMENTS TO NULLIFY THE PROVISIONS BENEFITTING THE LANDOWNING FARMERS
Kannada-0052-4451	NOTWITHSTANDING ITS RECENT ATTEMPTS AT DAMAGE CONTROL THIS GOVERNMENT HAS JUSTLY ACQUIRED THE REPUTATION OF BEING THE MOST ANTIFARMER GOVERNMENT IN THE HISTORY OF INDEPENDENT INDIA 
Kannada-0052-4452	WHATEVER THE FATE OF THE NOCONFIDENCE MOTION IN THE LOK SABHA THE MODI GOVERNMENT WOULD FIND IT HARD TO WIN A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE BROUGHT BY THE FARMERSIN JUST UNDER TWELVE MONTHS SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION IN PARLIAMENT THE CENTRE HAS QUIETLY WITHDRAWN THE FINANCIAL RESOLUTION AND DEPOSIT INSURANCE BILL 
Kannada-0052-4453	THE DECISION TO SEEK THE LOK SABHAS APPROVAL TO WITHDRAW THE LEGISLATION THIS WEEK IS A CLEAR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT
Kannada-0052-4454	THAT IT HAD UNDERESTIMATED THE EXTENT AND INTENSITY OF PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED LAW 
Kannada-0052-4455	ONE PROVISION IN THE BILL HAD IN PARTICULAR GENERATED THE GREATEST DEBATE AND ATTRACTED THE FIERCEST CRITICISM AND ULTIMATELY PROVED TO BE ITS VERY UNDOING THE BAILIN CLAUSE 
Kannada-0052-4456	THAT BANKS BY THE VERY NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESS ARE ESSENTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE FUNDS LENT TO THEM BY DEPOSITORS
Kannada-0052-4457	TO SERVE AS THE POOL OF LENDABLE RESOURCES FROM WHICH THEY PROVIDE CREDIT TO BORROWERS IS WELL KNOWN AND REQUIRES NO ELABORATION 
Kannada-0052-4458	SO WHEN A DEPOSITOR APPREHENDS THAT HER HARDEARNED SAVINGS PLACED IN A BANK MAY BE AT RISK FROM A LAW
Kannada-0052-4459	THAT FORCES HER TO PARTAKE IN THE PAIN OF FINANCIAL LOSSES IN CASE HER BANK IS FORCED INTO RESOLUTION ON ACCOUNT OF DISTRESS SHE WILL NATURALLY FEAR SUCH A LEGISLATION 
Kannada-0052-4460	THE GOVERNMENT DID MAKE STRENUOUS EFFORTS TO REASSURE THE PUBLIC EXPLAINING THE RATIONALE FOR THE BILL AS WELL AS THE BUILTIN SAFEGUARDS RELATING TO THE BAILIN PROVISION 
Kannada-0052-4461	HOWEVER ITS EXERTIONS MADE LITTLE HEADWAY 
Kannada-0052-4462	UNION MINISTER PIYUSH GOYAL FINALLY INFORMED THE JOINT PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE THAT WAS REVIEWING THE BILL
Kannada-0052-4463	A RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES WOULD REQUIRE A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION AND RECONSIDERATION AND THAT THEREFORE THE GOVERNMENT DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE BILL BE WITHDRAWN
Kannada-0052-4464	HOWEVER THE NEED FOR A SPECIALISED DISPENSATION TO COPE WITH LARGE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS ON THE VERGE OF GOING BUST CANNOT BE OVERSTATED
Kannada-0052-4465	ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CONTAGION RISK THAT A BANK FAILURE CAN POSE TO OVERALL FINANCIAL STABILITY
Kannada-0052-4466	THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FRDI BILL SHOULD THEREFORE BE USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY BY POLICYMAKERS TO REAPPRAISE THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK FOR RESOLVING BANKRUPTCY SCENARIOS AMONG FINANCIAL ENTITIES
Kannada-0052-4467	WHILE SUCH A REVIEW OUGHT TO INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE IN ADDRESSING THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF DEBT RESOLUTION IN THE BANKING SECTOR
Kannada-0052-4468	IT MUST ALSO LOOK AT WAYS TO STRENGTHEN THE DEPOSIT INSURANCE AND CREDIT GUARANTEE CORPORATION 
Kannada-0052-4469	SET UP IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COLLAPSE OF TWO BANKS THE DICGC WHICH GUARANTEES REPAYMENT OF BANK DEPOSITS UP TO ONE LAKH IN CASE A BANK IS LIQUIDATED
Kannada-0052-4470	THIS ANOMALY MUST BE ADDRESSED ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN SEVERAL STATERUN PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS HAVE BEEN ROILED BY A SERIES OF FRAUDS AND HIGH LEVELS OF BAD LOANS 
Kannada-0052-4471	ANY MEASURE THAT HELPS PREVENT FURTHER EROSION OF PUBLIC FAITH IN THE BELEAGUERED BANKING SYSTEM WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE VERY WELCOME
Kannada-0052-4472	TWO YEARS AFTER ACCEPTING THE JUSTICE RM LODHA COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATIONS THE SUPREME COURT HAS NOW EXTENDED SOME CONCESSIONS
Kannada-0052-4473	FROM THIS POSITION SO NEW SO EMBARRASSING SO ALARMING NOTHING BUT A COUNTERREVOLUTION OR A CIVIL WAR IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS COULD EXTRICATE HIM 
Kannada-0052-4474	HE WAS THEREFORE IMPELLED BY AMBITION AND BY FEAR TO ESPOUSE THE CAUSE OF THE FALLEN DYNASTY 
Kannada-0052-4475	AND IT IS BUT JUST TO SAY THAT MOTIVES NOBLER THAN AMBITION OR FEAR HAD A LARGE SHARE IN DETERMINING HIS COURSE 
Kannada-0052-4476	HIS HEART WAS NATURALLY COMPASSIONATE AND THIS WAS AN OCCASION WHICH COULD NOT FAIL TO CALL FORTH ALL HIS COMPASSION HIS SITUATION HAD PREVENTED HIS GOOD FEELINGS FROM FULLY DEVELOPING THEMSELVES 
Kannada-0052-4477	SYMPATHY IS RARELY STRONG WHERE THERE IS A GREAT INEQUALITY OF CONDITION 
Kannada-0052-4478	AND HE WAS RAISED SO HIGH ABOVE THE MASS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES THAT THEIR DISTRESSES EXCITED IN HIM ONLY A LANGUID PITY 
Kannada-0052-4479	SUCH AS THAT WITH WHICH WE REGARD THE SUFFERINGS OF THE INFERIOR ANIMALS OF A FAMISHED REDBREAST OR OF AN OVERDRIVEN POSTHORSE 
Kannada-0052-4480	THE DEVASTATION OF THE PALATINATE AND THE PERSECUTION OF THE HUGUENOTS HAD THEREFORE GIVEN HIM NO UNEASINESS WHICH PRIDE AND BIGOTRY COULD NOT EFFECTUALLY SOOTHE 
Kannada-0052-4481	BUT ALL THE TENDERNESS OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE WAS CALLED FORTH BY THE MISERY OF A GREAT KING 
Kannada-0052-4482	WHO HAD A FEW WEEKS AGO BEEN SERVED ON THE KNEE BY LORDS AND WHO WAS NOW A DESTITUTE EXILE 
Kannada-0052-4483	WITH THAT TENDERNESS WAS MINGLED IN THE SOUL OF LEWIS A NOT IGNOBLE VANITY 
Kannada-0052-4484	HE WOULD EXHIBIT TO THE WORLD A PATTERN OF MUNIFICENCE AND COURTESY 
Kannada-0052-4485	HE WOULD SHOW MANKIND WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE BEARING OF A PERFECT GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGHEST STATION AND ON THE GREATEST OCCASION 
Kannada-0052-4486	AND IN TRUTH HIS CONDUCT WAS MARKED BY A CHIVALROUS GENEROSITY AND URBANITY SUCH AS HAD NOT EMBELLISHED THE ANNALS OF EUROPE 
Kannada-0052-4487	SINCE THE BLACK PRINCE HAD STOOD BEHIND THE CHAIR OF KING JOHN AT THE SUPPER ON THE FIELD POITIERS
Kannada-0056-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE

Kannada-0056-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0056-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0056-4609	SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY PERSUADE BANKS TO EMBARK MORE QUICKLY ON A RESOLUTION PLAN FOR STRESSED ASSETS 
Kannada-0056-4610	THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE EARLIER MODEL WHICH RELIED SOLELY ON THE JOINT LENDERS FORUM TO ARRIVE AT A CONSENSUS AMONG CREDITORS
Kannada-0056-4611	IT IS IN FACT LOGICAL FOR JOINT LENDERS WHO WANT TO AVOID A DEADLOCK TO AGREE ON THE GROUND RULES OF DEBT RESOLUTION PRIOR TO LENDING TO ANY BORROWER 
Kannada-0056-4612	BUT THE OBLIGATION ON THE LEAD LENDER TO COME UP WITH A TIMEBOUND RESOLUTION PLAN CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
Kannada-0056-4613	BANKS MAY BE COMPELLED TO ENGAGE IN A QUICKFIRE SALE OF STRESSED ASSETS DUE TO ARBITRARY DEADLINES ON THE RESOLUTION PROCESS 
Kannada-0056-4614	THIS WILL WORK AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF LENDERS LOOKING TO GET THE BEST PRICE FOR THEIR STRESSED ASSETS 
Kannada-0056-4615	ALSO IT IS OFTEN IN THE INTEREST OF THE MAJORITY OF CREDITORS TO TAKE THE TIME TO EXTRACT THE MOST OUT OF THEIR ASSETS 
Kannada-0056-4616	MEANWHILE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO BAD LOAN RESOLUTION IS THE ABSENCE OF BUYERS WHO CAN PURCHASE STRESSED ASSETS FROM BANKS
Kannada-0056-4617	AND THE UNWILLINGNESS OF BANKS TO SELL THEIR LOANS AT A DEEP DISCOUNT TO THEIR FACE VALUE 
Kannada-0056-4618	UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THE BAD LOAN PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO REMAIN UNRESOLVED FOR SOME TIME TO COME
Kannada-0056-4619	FOR THE INDIAN RUPEE ALREADY GRAPPLING WITH HIGH CRUDE OIL PRICES AND THE GROWING HEFT OF THE US DOLLAR
Kannada-0056-4620	THE LATEST SHOCK HAS COME FROM A MOST UNEXPECTED QUARTER 
Kannada-0056-4621	THE CURRENCY WHICH WAS VALUED AT SIXTY THREE POINT EIGHT FOUR TO THE DOLLAR AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BRIEFLY CROSSED THE SEVENTYMARK IN EARLY TRADING ON TUESDAY ON ACCOUNT OF THE FALL IN THE TURKISH LIRA 
Kannada-0056-4622	THE LIRA HAS SLIPPED FORTY PECENT AGAINST THE US DOLLAR THIS YEAR BUT A BULK OF THAT DECLINE TOOK PLACE OVER JUST TWO DAYS 
Kannada-0056-4623	THERE ARE MANY FACTORS AT PLAY FOR TURKEYS CURRENCY CRISIS INCLUDING ITS STANDOFF WITH THE US
Kannada-0056-4624	THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS JUST SANCTIONED TURKEYS JUSTICE AND INTERIOR MINISTERS AND PLANS TO DOUBLE PUNITIVE TARIFFS ON STEEL AND ALUMINIUM IMPORTS FROM THE NATO MEMBERCOUNTRY 
Kannada-0056-4625	RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND TURKEY ARE TENSE WITH WASHINGTON REFUSING TO HAND OVER AN ISLAMIC CLERIC CHARGED BY THE ERDOGAN GOVERNMENT OF MASTERMINDING THE FAILED MILITARY COUP IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN
Kannada-0056-4626	A FEW DAYS AGO A POTENTIAL BILATERAL DEAL TO END TURKEYS CONTINUED DETENTION OF AN AMERICAN PASTOR AND THE INCARCERATION BY THE US OF A TURKISH BANKER COLLAPSED 
Kannada-0056-4627	BEYOND THE BILATERAL CONSEQUENCES THE CRASH OF THE LIRA HAS HAD A RIPPLE EFFECT ON MOST EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES CATCHING POLICYMAKERS OFF GUARD 
Kannada-0056-4628	THE SOUTH AFRICAN RAND FOR INSTANCE ON MONDAY HAD ITS BIGGEST SINGLEDAY FALL IN A DECADE
Kannada-0056-4629	IN CONTRAST THE RUPEES FALL FROM ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TO SEVENTY APPEARS MINOR 
Kannada-0056-4630	THE STOCK MARKETS WHICH TUMBLED ON MONDAY AS THE CURRENCY WEAKENED SEEMED TO TAKE THE RUPEES SLIDE IN THEIR STRIDE ON TUESDAY WITH THE SENSEX RISING BY HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT
Kannada-0056-4631	THERE IS IN FACT NO NEED TO PANIC ON ACCOUNT OF THE RUPEE 
Kannada-0056-4632	BARRING THE GRADUAL DECLINE IN ITS VALUE THIS YEAR THE INDIAN CURRENCY HAS BEEN FAIRLY STABLE OVER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN
Kannada-0056-4633	WITH INFLATION BEING HIGHER THAN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ITS PURCHASING POWER AT HOME HAS BEEN FALLING 
Kannada-0056-4634	THE FIRST ACT OF THE COMMONS WAS TO CHOOSE A SPEAKER AND THE CHOICE WHICH THEY MADE INDICATED IN A MANNER 
Kannada-0056-4635	NOT TO BE MISTAKEN THEIR OPINION TOUCHING THE GREAT QUESTIONS WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO DECIDE 
Kannada-0056-4636	DOWN TO THE VERY EVE OF THE MEETING IT HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SEYMOUR WOULD BE PLACED IN THE CHAIRHE HAD FORMERLY SATE THERE DURING SEVERAL YEARS
Kannada-0056-4637	HE HAD GREAT AND VARIOUS TITLES TO CONSIDERATION DESCENT FORTUNE KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE ELOQUENCE 
Kannada-0056-4638	HE HAD LONG BEEN AT THE HEAD OF A POWERFUL BAND OF MEMBERS FROM THE WESTERN COUNTIES
Kannada-0056-4639	THOUGH A TORY HE HAD IN THE LAST PARLIAMENT HEADED WITH CONSPICUOUS ABILITY AND COURAGE THE OPPOSITION TO POPERY AND ARBITRARY POWER 
Kannada-0056-4640	HE HAD BEEN AMONG THE FIRST GENTLEMEN WHO HAD REPAIRED TO THE DUTCH HEAD QUARTERS AT EUROPE 
Kannada-0056-4641	AND HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THAT ASSOCIATION BY WHICH THE PRINCES ADHERENTS HAD BOUND THEMSELVES TO STAND OR FALL TOGETHER 
Kannada-0056-4642	BUT A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE HOUSES MET A RUMOUR WAS SPREAD THAT SAM WAS AGAINST DECLARING THE THRONE VACANT 
Kannada-0056-4643	AS SOON THEREFORE AS THE BENCHES HAD FILLED THE EARL OF WILT WHO REPRESENTED HAMPSHIRE STOOD UP AND PROPOSED THAT POWLE SHOULD BE SPEAKER 
Kannada-0056-4644	SIR FANE MEMBER FOR KENT SECONDED THE MOTION A PLAUSIBLE OBJECTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN RAISED
Kannada-0056-4645	FOR IT WAS KNOWN THAT A PETITION WAS ABOUT TO BE PRESENTED AGAINST POWLES RETURN 
Kannada-0056-4646	BUT THE GENERAL CRY OF THE HOUSE CALLED HIM TO THE CHAIR AND THE TORIES THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO ACQUIESCE 
Kannada-0056-4647	THE MACE WAS THEN LAID ON THE TABLE THE LIST OF MEMBERS WAS CALLED OVER AND THE NAMES OF THE DEFAULTERS WERE NOTED

Kannada-0057-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0057-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0057-4648	AS FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER KAUSHIK BASU SAID LAST WEEK THE RUPEES CORRECT VALUE MAY BE CLOSER TO SEVENTYSEVENTY ONE TO THE DOLLAR
Kannada-0057-4649	AND ACHIEVING THAT LEVEL WILL BOOST JOBCREATING SECTORS LIKE EXPORTS THAT HAVE SEVERELY UNDERPERFORMED IN RECENT YEARS
Kannada-0057-4650	IN ADDITION WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES CURRENTLY AROUND FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS INDIA IS COMFORTABLY PLACED 
Kannada-0057-4651	WITH BOTH CONSUMER AND WHOLESALE PRICE INFLATION EASING IN JULY THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA WHICH HAS ONLY INTERVENED SPARINGLY IN THE FOREX MARKET SO FAR MAY HAVE ROOM TO HOLD OFF
Kannada-0057-4652	THE GLOBAL FLIGHT TO SAFETY TOWARDS THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE US DOLLAR AND THE PROSPECT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES REMAIN RISKS 
Kannada-0057-4653	BUT INDIA IS BETTERPLACED THAN MOST OTHER EMERGING ECONOMIES TO USE THIS TUMULT AS AN OPPORTUNITY INSTEAD OF SEEING IT AS A CALAMITY
Kannada-0057-4654	IN US PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPS SIMPLISTIC WORLDVIEW SLAPPING TARIFFS ON THE USS MAIN TRADING PARTNERS CANADA CHINA THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MEXICO
Kannada-0057-4655	IT WILL REDUCE US TRADE DEFICITS BRING BACK WELLPAYING MANUFACTURING JOBS AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Kannada-0057-4656	THIS HAS SUCH POPULIST APPEAL THAT PROTRADE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE LARGELY BEEN SILENT ON THE ISSUE
Kannada-0057-4657	SINCE CHINA FOR INSTANCE EXPORTED SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS TO THE US LAST YEAR BUT IMPORTED ONLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS
Kannada-0057-4658	MR TRUMP ASSUMES THAT CHINA COULD NOT MATCH THE ESCALATION IN TARIFFS SINCE IT HAS A WEAKER HAND 
Kannada-0057-4659	IN APRIL HE TWEETED WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS DOWN YOU CANT LOSE
Kannada-0057-4660	THIS APPROACH SIMPLY IGNORES THE COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS 
Kannada-0057-4661	IT ALSO GLOSSES OVER UNDERLYING PROBLEMS WITH THE US INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE 
Kannada-0057-4662	THESE CHANGES RATHER THAN GLOBALISATION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STAGNATION OF AVERAGE US WAGES IN REAL TERMS FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS
Kannada-0057-4663	NONCHINESE OWNED COMPANIES ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF CHINESE EXPORTS TO THE US 
Kannada-0057-4664	MUCH OF THIS CONSISTS OF VERY SPECIALISED PARTS REQUIRED BY US FACTORIES TO MAKE A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS RANGING FROM OUTBOARD MOTORS FOR BOATS TO COMPUTER ROUTERS 
Kannada-0057-4665	SINCE THESE NONCHINESE COMPANIES CANNOT EASILY RELOCATE THEIR OPERATIONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES
Kannada-0057-4666	THE NET RESULT IS THAT THE BURDEN OF THE TARIFFS WILL BE FELT BY CONSUMERS IN THE US 
Kannada-0057-4667	THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS IMPOSITION OF A TWENTY PERCENT TAX ON WASHING MACHINES IN FEBRUARY LED TO ITS PRICE GOING UP IN US STORES BY SIXTEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
Kannada-0057-4668	US IMPORTS FROM CHINA ALSO INCLUDE PRODUCTS WHICH CONTAIN PARTS MADE IN OTHER COUNTRIES
Kannada-0057-4669	THE PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS ESTIMATES THAT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST SHARE OF CHINESE EXPORTS TO THE US
Kannada-0057-4670	IT INCLUDES PARTS AND FINANCING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SOUTH KOREA JAPAN AND THE US ITSELF 
Kannada-0057-4671	SO NOT ONLY DOES THIS LIMIT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHINESE MANUFACTURING PRACTICES IT ALSO AFFECTS OTHER COUNTRIES 
Kannada-0057-4672	EVEN BEFORE MR TRUMP IMPOSED A TEN PERCENT TARIFF ON TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CHINESE GOODS IN JULY SOUTH KOREAS EXPORTS OF CARS AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TO CHINA FELL SUBSTANTIALLY
Kannada-0057-4673	THUS FAR NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HAD APPEARED BUT BOTH SIDES WERE PREPARING FOR THE CONFLICT 
Kannada-0057-4674	THE TORIES WERE STRONG IN THE UPPER HOUSE AND WEAK IN THE LOWER AND THEY KNEW THAT AT SUCH A CONJUNCTURE 
Kannada-0057-4675	THE HOUSE WHICH SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO COME TO A RESOLUTION WOULD HAVE A GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER 
Kannada-0057-4676	THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST CHANCE THAT THE COMMONS WOULD SEND UP TO THE LORDS A VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THE PLAN OF REGENCY 
Kannada-0057-4677	BUT IF SUCH A VOTE WERE SENT DOWN FROM THE LORDS TO THE COMMONS IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE 
Kannada-0057-4678	THAT MANY EVEN OF THE WHIG REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE MIGHT BE DISPOSED TO SERVILITY 
Kannada-0057-4679	RATHER THAN TAKE THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY OF CAUSING DISCORD AND DELAY AT A CRISIS WHICH REQUIRED UNION AND EXPEDITION 
Kannada-0057-4680	THE COMMONS HAD DETERMINED THAT ON MONDAY THE TWENTYEIGHTH OF JANUARY THEY WOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE STATE OF THE NATION 
Kannada-0057-4681	THE TORY LORDS THEREFORE PROPOSED ON FRIDAY THE TWENTYFIFTH TO ENTER INSTANTLY ON THE GREAT BUSINESS FOR WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CALLED TOGETHER 
Kannada-0057-4682	BUT THEIR MOTIVES WERE CLEARLY DISCERNED AND THEIR TACTICS FRUSTRATED BY HALIFAX WHO EVER SINCE HIS RETURN FROM HUNGERFORD 
Kannada-0057-4683	HAD SEEN THAT THE SETTLEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE EFFECTED ON WHIG PRINCIPLES ONLY
Kannada-0057-4684	AND WHO HAD THEREFORE FOR THE TIME ALLIED HIMSELF CLOSELY WITH THE WHIGS 
Kannada-0057-4685	DEVONSHIRE MOVED THAT TUESDAY THE TWENTYNINTH SHOULD BE THE DAY BY THAT TIME HE SAID WITH MORE TRUTH THAN DISCRETION 
Kannada-0057-4686	WE MAY HAVE SOME LIGHTS FROM BELOW WHICH MAY BE USEFUL FOR OUR GUIDANCE 
Kannada-0057-4687	HIS MOTION WAS CARRIED BUT HIS LANGUAGE WAS SEVERELY CENSURED BY SOME OF HIS BROTHER PEERS AS DEROGATORY TO THEIR ORDER

Kannada-0058-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0058-4688	ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR MARY LOVELY OF SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY US MERCHANDISE EXPORTS FROM CHINA ACCOUNT FOR ONLY THREE PERCENT OF CHINESE MANUFACTURING REVENUE 
Kannada-0058-4689	AND THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON A POTENTIAL REDUCTION OF THESE EXPORTS IS FURTHER DIMINISHED BY A SEVEN PERCENT FALL IN THE VALUE OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY 
Kannada-0058-4690	BEIJING ALSO HAS MORE THAN ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RESERVES TO CUSHION THE BRUNT OF A TRADE WAR WITH WASHINGTON
Kannada-0058-4691	THE RETALIATORY TARIFFS CHINA HAS IMPOSED ON US PRODUCTS HAVE ALSO HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GERMAN CAR PRODUCERS IN THE US
Kannada-0058-4692	WHERE BMW HAS ITS LARGEST FACTORY IN SPARTANBURG SOUTH CAROLINA RATHER THAN IN ITS HOME COUNTRY 
Kannada-0058-4693	BY RAISING DUTIES ON SOYBEANS AND PORK IT HAS STRUCK AT MR TRUMPS KEY CONSTITUENCIES OF SUPPORT IN THE US MIDWEST 
Kannada-0058-4694	BEIJINGS TARIFFS EVEN HIT KENTUCKY BOURBON TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL WHO REPRESENTS THAT STATE
Kannada-0058-4695	SIMILARLY THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TARIFF IMPOSED ON MEXICAN STEEL EXPORTS TO THE US HAS HAD NO IMPACT ON THE MEXICAN AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY 
Kannada-0058-4696	THE NORTHERN MEXICAN CITY OF MATAMOROS PRODUCES NINETY PERCENT OF ALL STEERING WHEELS USED IN US VEHICLES AND THE CITY IS ALSO THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF WINDSHIELD WIPERS IN NORTH AMERICA
Kannada-0058-4697	INSTEAD THESE TARIFFS BY RAISING THE COST OF PRODUCTION COMPELLED US COMPANIES TO REDUCE EMPLOYMENT

Kannada-0058-4704	IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED LEGISLATION AND THE COURTS HAVE MADE IT EASIER TO FIRE UNION ORGANISERS
Kannada-0058-4705	TO USE SCABS TO BREAK STRIKES AND FOR EMPLOYERS TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST UNIONISATION OF WORKERS
Kannada-0058-4706	AS A RESULT LESS THAN SEVEN PERCENT OF PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES TODAY ARE UNIONISED COMPARED TO A THIRD IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

Kannada-0058-4708	IT HAS BECOME EASIER FOR LARGE COMPANIES TO MERGE AND FORM GIANT OLIGOPOLIES 
Kannada-0058-4709	AT ITS PEAK IN THE MIDNINETEEN NINETYS THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND PUBLICLY TRADED FIRMS IN THE US STOCK MARKET 
Kannada-0058-4710	RECENTLY APPLE BECAME THE FIRST COMPANY TO HAVE A ONE TRILLION DOLLARS VALUATION AND TODAY JUST THIRTY COMPANIES REAP HALF OF ALL PROFITS PRODUCED BY ALL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES

Kannada-0058-4721	HE WAS ASKED BY WHOM THE PETITION WAS SIGNED THERE ARE NO HANDS TO IT YET HE ANSWERED BUT WHEN I BRING IT HERE NEXT THERE SHALL BE HANDS ENOUGH

Kannada-0058-4723	THAT THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE CONVENTION SHOULD BE PERFECTLY FREE AND THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE POWER OF ANY ADHERENT OF JAMES TO ALLEGE THAT EITHER HOUSE HAD ACTED UNDER FORCE 
Kannada-0058-4724	A PETITION SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO LOVELACE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BUT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY REJECTED

Kannada-0059-4742	WHY IS HISTORY SUCH AN IMPORTANT SCHOOL SUBJECT AND WHY DOES IT NOT RECEIVE THE IMPORTANCE IT DESERVES 
Kannada-0059-4743	THESE TWO WERE AMONG THE MAJOR QUESTIONS DEBATED AT A CONFERENCE RECENTLY HELD IN KOLKATA 
Kannada-0059-4744	A BRIEF ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT HISTORY CANNOT COMPETE WITH SCIENCE SUBJECTS IN THE MARKET THAT SHAPES AND CONTROLS EDUCATION TODAY 
Kannada-0059-4745	YET HISTORY IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT BECAUSE IT MOULDS THE OUTLOOK OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION
Kannada-0059-4746	BY TURNING THE PAST INTO A NARRATIVE HISTORY CREATES A PUBLIC ETHOS AND INFLUENCES CULTURE
Kannada-0059-4747	FROM ARCHITECTURE TO FILM AND FROM ANCIENT INDIA TO PARTITION THE KOLKATA CONFERENCE ORGANISED BY THE HISTORY FOR PEACE INITIATIVE OF THE SEAGULL FOUNDATION FOR THE ARTS
Kannada-0059-4748	COVERED A BROAD CANVAS TO TRACE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HISTORY AND CULTURE
Kannada-0059-4749	I CAN THINK OF FEW OTHER GATHERINGS WHERE SCHOOL TEACHERS GOT A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THEIR CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE WITH SCHOLARS OF HISTORY AND CULTURE 
Kannada-0059-4750	THE HISTORY SYLLABUS AND TEXTBOOKS HAVE BEEN AT THE HEART OF A DEEP POLITICAL CONTROVERSY IN INDIA INDIA IS NOT ALONE IN THIS RESPECT 
Kannada-0059-4751	NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS IMMUNE TO DEBATES ABOUT THE PAST AND HOW IT SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO SCHOOL CHILDREN 
Kannada-0059-4752	TO TAKE JUST TWO INSTANCES AMERICAS DISCOMFORT WITH HIROSHIMA AND BRITAINS DISCOMFORT WITH GANDHI CONTINUE TO BE REFLECTED IN THEIR SCHOOL SYLLABI
Kannada-0059-4753	THE MEETING BROKE UP AND WHAT THE PRINCE HAD SAID WAS IN A FEW HOURS KNOWN ALL OVER LONDON THAT HE MUST BE KING WAS NOW CLEAR 
Kannada-0059-4754	THE ONLY QUESTION WAS WHETHER HE SHOULD HOLD THE REGAL DIGNITY ALONE OR CONJOINTLY WITH THE PRINCESS 
Kannada-0059-4755	HALIFAX AND A FEW OTHER POLITICIANS WHO SAW IN A STRONG LIGHT THE DANGER OF DIVIDING THE SUPREME EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE THAT 
Kannada-0059-4756	DURING WILLIAMS LIFE MARY SHOULD BE ONLY QUEEN CONSORT AND A SUBJECT 
Kannada-0059-4757	BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT THOUGH MUCH MIGHT DOUBTLESS BE SAID FOR IT IN ARGUMENT SHOCKED THE GENERAL FEELING EVEN OF THOSE ENGLISHMEN WHO WERE MOST ATTACHED TO THE PRINCE 
Kannada-0059-4758	HIS WIFE HAD GIVEN AN UNPRECEDENTED PROOF OF CONJUGAL SUBMISSION AND AFFECTION 
Kannada-0059-4759	AND THE VERY LEAST RETURN THAT COULD BE MADE TO HER WOULD BE TO BESTOW ON HER THE DIGNITY OF QUEEN REGNANT 
Kannada-0059-4760	WILLIAM ONE OF THE MOST ZEALOUS OF THE PRINCES ADHERENTS WAS SO MUCH EXASPERATED THAT HE SPRANG OUT OF THE BED TO WHICH HE WAS CONFINED BY GOUT 
Kannada-0059-4761	AND VEHEMENTLY DECLARED THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DRAWN A SWORD IN HIS HIGHNESSS CAUSE IF HE HAD FORESEEN THAT SO SHAMEFUL AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE MADE 
Kannada-0059-4762	NO PERSON TOOK THE MATTER UP SO EAGERLY AS BURNET HIS BLOOD BOILED AT THE WRONG DONE TO HIS KIND PATRONESS 
Kannada-0059-4763	HE EXPOSTULATED VEHEMENTLY WITH BEN AND BEGGED TO BE PERMITTED TO RESIGN THE CHAPLAINSHIP 
Kannada-0059-4764	WHILE I AM HIS HIGHNESSS SERVANT SAID THE BRAVE AND HONEST DIVINE IT WOULD BE UNSEEMLY IN ME TO OPPOSE ANY PLAN WHICH MAY HAVE HIS COUNTENANCE 
Kannada-0059-4765	I THEREFORE DESIRE TO BE SET FREE THAT I MAY FIGHT THE PRINCESSS BATTLE WITH EVERY FACULTY THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME
Kannada-0059-4766	BEN PREVAILED ON BROWN TO DEFER AN OPEN DECLARATION OF HOSTILITIES TILL WILLIAMS RESOLUTION SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY KNOWN 
Kannada-0059-4767	IN A FEW HOURS THE SCHEME WHICH HAD EXCITED SO MUCH RESENTMENT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP

Kannada-0060-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Kannada-0060-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Kannada-0060-4769	THE MAIN REASON WHY PORTRAYAL OF THE PAST IN SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS AROUSES CONTROVERSY IS THAT A PUBLICLY SHARED PAST IMPARTS A COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND IDENTITY 
Kannada-0060-4770	TEXTBOOKS ARE VIEWED AS OFFICIALLY APPROVED DOCUMENTS EVEN IF THEY ARE PRIVATELY PRODUCED AND HAVE NO OFFICIAL SANCTION AND ARE THEREFORE BELIEVED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH STATE POWER 
Kannada-0060-4771	SIGNIFICANTLY THEY DO SHAPE THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE YOUNG BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE IMPRESSIONABLE 
Kannada-0060-4772	CHILDREN INTRODUCED TO A CERTAIN VERSION OF THE PAST AT SCHOOL ACQUIRE A DISPOSITION WHICH CAN BE POLITICALLY MOBILISED IN THE FUTURE
Kannada-0060-4773	DEBATES OVER SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS SELDOM TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CURRICULAR DESIGN AND THE PREPARATION OF A SYLLABUS 
Kannada-0060-4774	WHEN CRITICISING POOR QUALITY TEXTBOOKS PEOPLE DO NOT RECOGNISE THAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE AT THE LEVEL OF SYLLABUS AND CURRICULUM 
Kannada-0060-4775	SIMILARLY WHEN GOOD TEXTBOOKS ARE APPRECIATED PEOPLE SELDOM REALISE THE EFFORT REQUIRED IN REDESIGNING THE CURRICULUM AND SYLLABUS
Kannada-0060-4776	THE NEW HISTORY TEXTBOOKS BROUGHT OUT BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND TRAINING NCERT FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX ONWARDS ARE A CASE IN POINT 
Kannada-0060-4777	THEY HAVE SURVIVED THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT ONE REASON FOR THEIR LONGEVITY IS THEIR PROFESSIONAL QUALITY 
Kannada-0060-4778	THEY HAVE NO SINGLE AUTHORS TEAMS OF EMINENT HISTORIANS WORKED THROUGH DELIBERATION AND DIALOGUE FIRST DRAFTING A NEW SYLLABUS AND THEN THE TEXT ITSELF 
Kannada-0060-4779	THEY REPRESENT THE SPIRIT OF THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHICH IS STILL IN PLACE WHICH GIVES PRECEDENCE TO INQUIRY THROUGH DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EVIDENCE 
Kannada-0060-4780	THE TEXTBOOKS BASED ON IT DO NOT NARRATE A LONG STORY 
Kannada-0060-4781	INSTEAD THEY ENABLE CHILDREN TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT OFTEN DIVERGENT THEMES SUCH AS LIVES OF PEASANTS AND WOMEN ARCHITECTURAL STYLES ETC 
Kannada-0060-4782	ARCHIVAL MATERIAL IS CITED AS EVIDENCE AND DEBATES AMONG HISTORIANS ARE HIGHLIGHTED TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFICULTIES OF INTERPRETING EVIDENCE
Kannada-0060-4783	THESE BOOKS MARK A MAJOR STEP FORWARD IN THE TEACHING OF HISTORY BUT OLDER WAYS OF TEACHING AND CONVENTIONAL TEXTBOOKS HAVE PERSISTED 
Kannada-0060-4784	AS A PRESENTATION AT THE KOLKATA CONFERENCE POINTED OUT THE HISTORY TEACHER AT SCHOOL IS OFTEN SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT STUDIED HISTORY OR ENJOYED IT 
Kannada-0060-4785	SO DESPITE A SHIFT IN HISTORIOGRAPHY OLD PROBLEMS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE SYSTEM 
Kannada-0060-4786	ONE OF THESE IS THE PERCEPTION THAT HISTORY IS ALL ABOUT WARS KINGS AND DATES
Kannada-0060-4787	ANOTHER IS THE TENACITY OF DIVIDING INDIAS PAST INTO THREE LONG CHUNKS ANCIENT MEDIEVAL AND MODERN 
Kannada-0060-4788	THESE CATEGORIES FLATTEN OUT THE COMPLEXITY AND RICHNESS OF INDIAS HISTORY WASTING THE OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING IT WITH THE AIM OF AROUSING CURIOSITY AND IMPARTING TOOLS OF INQUIRY
Kannada-0060-4789	THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM ALSO REINFORCES FLAT PERCEPTIONS BY ASKING QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEST ANSWERED WITH THE HELP OF GUIDEBOOKS 
Kannada-0060-4790	THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE CURRICULAR REVOLUTION HAS MADE LITTLE IMPACT ON THIS WIDER SCENE
Kannada-0060-4791	IN MOST STATES THE USE OF HISTORY TO BUILD COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND IDENTITY CONTINUES 
Kannada-0060-4792	ASSAMLIKE SITUATIONS SUGGEST THAT EDUCATION IS NOT PERCEIVED AS A MEANS OF RESOLVING A PROBLEM 
Kannada-0060-4793	THE FEAR THAT INCOMING MIGRANTS WOULD PUSH THE REGIONAL LANGUAGE INTO MINORITY STATUS OR HURT THE STATES CULTURAL IDENTITY SHOWS HOW POOR THE STATES TRUST IN EDUCATION IS
Kannada-0060-4794	WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DONE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR RULERS TO MISUNDERSTAND THE LAW
Kannada-0060-4795	BUT UNLESS SOMETHING MORE WERE DONE IT WAS BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT THEY MIGHT VIOLATE IT 
Kannada-0060-4796	UNHAPPILY THE CHURCH HAD LONG TAUGHT THE NATION THAT HEREDITARY MONARCHY ALONE AMONG OUR INSTITUTIONS WAS DIVINE AND INVIOLABLE 
Kannada-0060-4797	THAT THE RIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS TO A SHARE IN THE LEGISLATIVE POWER WAS A RIGHT MERELY HUMAN
Kannada-0060-4798	BUT THAT THE RIGHT OF THE KING TO THE OBEDIENCE OF HIS PEOPLE WAS FROM ABOVE 
Kannada-0060-4799	THAT THE GREAT CHARTER WAS A STATUTE WHICH MIGHT BE REPEALED BY THOSE WHO HAD MADE IT 
Kannada-0060-4800	BUT THAT THE RULE WHICH CALLED THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL TO THE THRONE 
Kannada-0060-4801	IN ORDER OF SUCCESSION WAS OF CELESTIAL ORIGIN AND THAT ANY ACT OF PARLIAMENT INCONSISTENT WITH THAT RULE WAS A NULLITY 
Kannada-0060-4802	IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH SUCH SUPERSTITIONS PREVAIL CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM MUST EVER BE INSECURE 
Kannada-0060-4803	A POWER WHICH IS REGARDED MERELY AS THE ORDINANCE OF MAN CANNOT BE AN EFFICIENT CHECK ON A POWER WHICH IS REGARDED AS THE ORDINANCE OF GOD 
Kannada-0060-4804	IT IS VAIN TO HOPE THAT LAWS HOWEVER EXCELLENT WILL PERMANENTLY RESTRAIN A KING WHO IN HIS OWN OPINION AND IN THAT OF A GREAT PART OF HIS PEOPLE 
Kannada-0060-4805	HAS AN AUTHORITY INFINITELY HIGHER IN KIND THAN THE AUTHORITY WHICH BELONGS TO THOSE LAWS 
Kannada-0060-4806	TO DEPRIVE ROYALTY OF THESE MYSTERIOUS ATTRIBUTES AND TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT KINGS REIGNED BY A RIGHT IN NO RESPECT DIFFERING FROM THE RIGHT 
Kannada-0060-4807	BY WHICH FREEHOLDERS CHOSE KNIGHTS OF THE SHIRE OR FROM THE RIGHT BY WHICH JUDGES GRANTED WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY OF OUR LIBERTIES

Malayalam-0058-0968	HUMANCAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE IS ON TRACK TO MAKE THE ARCTIC OCEAN FUNCTIONALLY ICEFREE FOR PART OF EACH YEAR STARTING SOMETIME BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTY FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY SEVEN ACCORDING TO A STUDY
Malayalam-0058-0969	RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES UCLA IN THE US NOTED THAT AS LONG AS HUMANS HAVE BEEN ON EARTH THE PLANET HAS HAD A LARGE CAP OF SEA ICE AT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE THAT EXPANDS EACH WINTER AND CONTRACTS EACH SUMMER
Malayalam-0058-0970	SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE AMOUNT OF SEA ICE IN THE ARCTIC IN SEPTEMBER  THE MONTH WHEN THERE IS THE LEAST SEA ICE BEFORE WATER STARTS FREEZING AGAIN  HAS DECLINED BY THIRTEEN PER CENT PER DECADE THE RESEARCHERS SAID
Malayalam-0058-0971	SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE OF ARCTIC SEA ICE FOR SEVERAL DECADES RELYING ON AN ARRAY OF GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS THAT SIMULATE HOW THE CLIMATE SYSTEM WILL REACT TO ALL OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE
Malayalam-0058-0972	HOWEVER THE MODELS PREDICTIONS HAVE DISAGREED WIDELY ACCORDING TO THE STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
Malayalam-0058-0973	AMONG THE CURRENT GENERATION OF MODELS SOME SHOW ICEFREE SEPTEMBERS AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SIX WHILE OTHERS SUGGEST THE PHENOMENON WILL BEGIN AS LATE AS TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO
Malayalam-0058-0974	THE STUDYS LEAD AUTHOR CHAD THACKERAY AN ASSISTANT RESEARCHER AT UCLA SAID ONE REASON PREDICTIONS ABOUT SEA ICE LOSS DIVERGE SO MUCH IS THAT THEY DIFFER IN HOW THEY CONSIDER A PROCESS CALLED SEA ICE ALBEDO FEEDBACK
Malayalam-0058-0975	THE PROCESS OCCURS WHEN A PATCH OF SEA ICE COMPLETELY MELTS UNCOVERING A SEAWATER SURFACE THAT IS DARKER AND ABSORBS MORE SUNLIGHT THAN ICE WOULD HAVE
Malayalam-0058-0976	THAT CHANGE IN THE SURFACES REFLECTIVITY OF SUNLIGHT OR ALBEDO CAUSES GREATER LOCAL WARMING WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO FURTHER ICE MELT THE RESEARCHERS SAID
Malayalam-0058-0977	THE CYCLE EXACERBATES WARMING  ONE REASON THE ARCTIC IS HEATING UP TWICE AS FAST AS THE REST OF THE GLOBE THEY SAID
Malayalam-0058-0978	THACKERAY AND COAUTHOR ALEX HALL A UCLA PROFESSOR NOTED THAT SEA ICE ALBEDO FEEDBACK NOT ONLY HAPPENS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT ALSO HAPPENS EVERY SUMMER WHEN SEA ICE MELTS FOR THE SEASON

Malayalam-0058-0981	THEY RETAINED THE SIX MODELS THAT BEST CAPTURED THE ACTUAL HISTORICAL RESULTS AND DISCARDED THE ONES THAT HAD PROVEN TO BE OFF BASE ENABLING THEM TO NARROW THE RANGE OF PREDICTIONS FOR ICEFREE SEPTEMBERS IN THE ARCTIC
Malayalam-0058-0982	ARCTIC SEA ICE IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE EARTH SYSTEM BECAUSE OF ITS HIGHLY REFLECTIVE NATURE WHICH KEEPS THE GLOBAL CLIMATE RELATIVELY COOL THACKERAY SAID
Malayalam-0058-0983	THERE ARE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS TO ICE LOSS AS WELL THE RESEARCHERS SAID

Tamil-0002-8119	THE SUPREME COURT NOTED THIS WHEN IT OBSERVED IN A JUDGMENT LAST YEAR THAT RISING INTOLERANCE AND GROWING POLARISATION EXPRESSED THROUGH A SPATE OF INCIDENTS OF MOB VIOLENCE CANNOT BE PERMITTED TO BECOME THE NORMAL WAY OF LIFE OR THE NORMAL STATE OF LAW AND ORDER
Tamil-0002-8120	IT DIRECTED STATES TO TAKE SPECIFIC PREVENTIVE PUNITIVE AND REMEDIAL MEASURES
Tamil-0002-8121	IT MOOTED A SPECIAL LAW TO DEAL WITH LYNCHING AND THE APPOINTMENT OF A NODAL OFFICER IN EACH DISTRICT TO COMBAT THE THREAT
Tamil-0002-8122	WHILE THESE MEASURES ARE NOT YET IN PLACE THE LATEST INCIDENT MUST BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED AND THE PERPETRATORS BROUGHT TO BOOK
Tamil-0002-8123	HOWEVER THE LARGER ISSUE HAS TO BE FACED SQUARELY BY THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP
Tamil-0002-8124	ORGANISED VIGILANTISM BY COW PROTECTION GROUPS WAS INITIALLY BEHIND A WAVE OF LYNCHINGS RUMOURMONGERING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS CAME NEXT
Tamil-0002-8125	THE ANSARI INCIDENT SHOWS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS TRANSMOGRIFIED INTO A SINISTER FORM OF ENFORCING THE CHANTING OF HINDU SLOGANS BY CITIZENS PROFESSING OTHER RELIGIONS
Tamil-0002-8126	IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE UNSEEMLY POLITICAL USE OF THE RELIGIOUS CHANT OF JAI SHRI RAM IN PARLIAMENT BY SOME RULING PARTY MEMBERS TO HECKLE THOSE IN THE OPPOSITION RANKS IS FINDING ITS ECHO ON THE STREETS
Tamil-0002-8127	CHENNAIS ASPIRATIONS TO GROW INTO A GLOBAL ECONOMIC HUB APPEAR CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED AS IT STRUGGLES TO FIND WATER
Tamil-0002-8128	THE SHADOW OF DROUGHT FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAS STRETCHED INTO THE TORRID SUMMER THIS YEAR EVAPORATING NOT JUST THE CITYS RESERVOIRS BUT THE PROSPERITY OF ITS RESIDENTS WHO ARE FORCED TO HUNT FOR TANKERS PAY BRIBES AND SPEND HOURS EVEN AT NIGHT WAITING FOR TRUCKS TO DISPENSE SOME WATER
Tamil-0002-8129	IRONICALLY TAMIL NADUS CAPITAL WHICH IN A NORMAL YEAR GETS ANYTHING BETWEEN THIRTEEN HUNDRED MM AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED MM OF RAINFALL HAS BEEN LAID LOW BY THE INDIFFERENCE OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS
Tamil-0002-8130	THAT RESIDENTS ARE NOW GIVEN MINIMUM PIPED WATER AND MEAGRE TANKER SUPPLIES TOTALLING A THIRD OF THE INSTALLED CAPACITY OF FIFTEEN HUNDREDMILLION LITRES A DAY THAT TOO MAINLY FROM DESALINATION PLANTS FARAWAY LAKES AND FARM WELLS IS PROOF OF THE NEGLECT OF WATER GOVERNANCE
Tamil-0002-8131	YET EVEN SEARCHING QUESTIONS POSED BY THE MADRAS HIGH COURT TO THE AIADMK GOVERNMENT HAVE ELICITED ONLY VAGUE ASSURANCES ON MEETING BASIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESTORING TWO TEN WATERBODIES TO AUGMENT FUTURE STORAGE RATHER THAN A FIRM TIMELINE
Tamil-0002-8132	CHIEF MINISTER EDAPPADI KPALANISWAMI WAS WRONG TO DISMISS REPORTS ON WATER SCARCITY AS AN EXAGGERATION AND HE MUST END THIS BUSINESSASUSUAL APPROACH
Tamil-0002-8133	A TIMEBOUND PLAN IS NEEDED TO AUGMENT THE RESOURCES IN THE GREATER CHENNAI REGION ENCOMPASSING THE NEIGHBOURING DISTRICTS OF THIRUVALLUR AND KANCHEEPURAM
Tamil-0002-8134	THIS PLAN SHOULD BE TASKED TO A SPECIAL OFFICER TO BE FRAMED BY OFFICIALS IN CONSULTATION WITH CREDENTIALED EXPERTS IN RESEARCH AND ACADEMIA AND PUBLIC COMMENTS INVITED BEFORE IT IS FINALISED
Tamil-0002-8135	GIVEN THE LARGE BASE OF TANKS AND RESERVOIRS IN GREATER CHENNAI  OVER FOUR THOUSAND WATERBODIES OF SIGNIFICANCE  PRUDENT RAINFALL MANAGEMENT CAN HELP IT THROUGH WITHERING SUMMERS AND WEAK MONSOONS
Tamil-0002-8136	A WHITE PAPER WITH A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THESE WETLANDS AND THEIR STORAGE POTENTIAL SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE STATES SUSTAINABLE WATER SECURITY MISSION
Tamil-0002-8137	DEEPENING STORAGE IN THE FOUR MAJOR RESERVOIRS MUST GET PRIORITY
Tamil-0002-8138	SUCH A PROJECT MUST QUANTIFY THE INCREASE IN STORAGE AND SET AN EARLY DEADLINE OF A YEAR
Tamil-0002-8139	THESE MEASURES CAN HARVEST THE BULK OF THE RAIN IN A GOOD YEAR AND PROVE SUPERIOR TO THE FIREFIGHTING APPROACH OF INSTALLING EXPENSIVE DESALINATION PLANTS AND BRINGING SMALL QUANTITIES BY RAIL FROM ANOTHER DISTRICT
Tamil-0002-8140	TAMIL NADU MADE RAINWATER HARVESTING MANDATORY QUITE EARLY BUT FAILED TO FOLLOW IT UP WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM TO HELP CITIZENS IMPLEMENT IT
Tamil-0002-8141	THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE MONETARY INCENTIVES TO NGOS AS NITI AAYOG PROPOSED IN ITS WATER INDEX REPORT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO INSTALL SYSTEMS AND SHOW QUANTIFIABLE RECHARGE OUTCOMES
Tamil-0002-8142	ON THE CONSUMER SIDE DEVICES AND PRACTICES TO REDUCE WASTAGE SHOULD BE PROMOTED ESPECIALLY ON COMMERCIAL PREMISES
Tamil-0002-8143	PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING TO THE WISE MAN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEMS EVERY TIME 
Tamil-0002-8144	ONE DAY HE TOLD THEM A JOKE AND EVERYONE ROARED IN LAUGHTER
Tamil-0002-8145	AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES HE TOLD THEM THE SAME JOKE AND ONLY A FEW OF THEM SMILED
Tamil-0002-8146	WHEN HE TOLD THE SAME JOKE FOR THE THIRD TIME NO ONE LAUGHED ANYMORE
Tamil-0002-8147	THE WISE MAN SMILED AND SAID
Tamil-0002-8148	YOU CANT LAUGH AT THE SAME JOKE OVER AND OVER SO WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS CRYING ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM
Tamil-0002-8149	MORAL OF THE STORY WORRYING WONT SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS ITLL JUST WASTE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY
Tamil-0004-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE

Tamil-0004-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0004-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0004-8186	MRHUNT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SEEN AS A HEAVYWEIGHT WHOSE VAST EXPERIENCE IN PROMOTING BUSINESS VENTURES COULD REFRESH THE PARTYS MARKETFRIENDLY IMAGE
Tamil-0004-8187	AS HEALTH SECRETARY HE HAD SECURED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE NHS
Tamil-0004-8188	MRHUNT HAS WARNED OF THE DANGERS OF LEAVING THE EU WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT INCLUDING ANOTHER GENERAL ELECTION THAT COULD DAMAGE THE CONSERVATIVES PROSPECTS
Tamil-0004-8189	THE CONTEST IS ABOVE ALL ELSE REALLY ABOUT PICKING A LEADER WHO CAN STEER THE PARTY THROUGH BRITAINS NEXT GENERAL ELECTION AND ENSURE ITS FUTURE RELEVANCE
Tamil-0004-8190	THAT MEANS SOMEBODY WHO CAN STOP JEREMY CORBYN THE LABOUR LEADER FROM ENTERING TEN DOWNING STREET
Tamil-0004-8191	AFTER A DISMAL SHOWING IN THE MAY POLLS TO THE EU PARLIAMENT THE CONSERVATIVES ALSO FEAR SUPPORT AMONG THE RANK AND FILE HAEMORRHAGING TO NIGEL FARAGES BREXIT PARTY
Tamil-0004-8192	DELIVERING ON THE TWENTY SIXTEEN REFERENDUM RESULT IN WHATEVER FORM AND AT ANY PRICE IS SEEN IN CONSERVATIVE STRONGHOLDS AS THE ULTIMATE ROUTE TO RESURRECTION
Tamil-0004-8193	MEANWHILE THERE ARE NOT MANY WHO SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT BRITAIN CAN REALISTICALLY RENEGOTIATE BEFORE THE END OF OCTOBER THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT MSMAY SIGNED WITH THE EU LAST YEARBRUSSELS HAS REPEATEDLY STRESSED ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO REOPEN THE DEAL STILL LESS THE CONTENTIOUS IRISH BACKSTOP
Tamil-0004-8194	THE PRIME MINISTERS ELECTION IN JULY WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY PARLIAMENTS SUMMER RECESS ALLOWING MPS LITTLE TIME FOR LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS
Tamil-0004-8195	SHORT OF A SPECTACULAR TURNAROUND THE OUTCOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE CONTEST LOOKS FAIRLY PREDICTABLE
Tamil-0004-8196	CONVERSELY THE COURSE OF BREXIT IS ANYTHING BUT CERTAIN IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER MRJOHNSON OR MRHUNT WINS THE BATTLE OF THE BALLOT
Tamil-0004-8197	USPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMPS DECISION TO PULL BACK FROM AIR STRIKES ON IRAN AFTER THE LATTER SHOT DOWN AN AMERICAN DRONE NEAR THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ WAS A RARE MOMENT OF RESTRAINT AMID OTHERWISE ESCALATING TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
Tamil-0004-8198	THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PULLBACK ACCORDING TO MRTRUMP WAS THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO CAUSE ANY LOSS OF IRANIAN LIVES AS NO AMERICAN LIVES WERE HURT BY THE IRANIANS
Tamil-0004-8199	CLEARLY MRTRUMP WHO HAD CAMPAIGNED AGAINST THE COSTLY WARS OF THE USOVERSEAS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE IN FAVOUR OF LAUNCHING AN OPEN CONFLICT WITH IRAN
Tamil-0004-8200	A WAR WITH IRAN COULD BE PROLONGED AND DISASTROUS
Tamil-0004-8201	IRAN HAS BALLISTIC MISSILES PROXY MILITIAS AND A RELATIVELY VIBRANT NAVY
Tamil-0004-8202	AND THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ THROUGH WHICH ONETHIRD OF THE WORLDS SEABORNE OIL SHIPMENTS MOVE IS WITHIN ITS RANGE
Tamil-0004-8203	MRTRUMP DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE A RISK UNLESS THERE ARE PROVOCATIONS FROM IRAN TARGETING AMERICAN LIVES
Tamil-0004-8204	WHILE THIS APPROACH IS BETTER THAN THAT OF MRTRUMPS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON WHO HAS THREATENED IRAN WITH WAR SEVERAL TIMES WHAT THE USPRESIDENT OVERLOOKS IS THAT THE CURRENT STATE OF TENSIONS IS A PRODUCT OF HIS MAXIMUM PRESSURE TACTIC
Tamil-0004-8205	A YEAR AGO MRTRUMP PULLED THE USOUT OF A NUCLEAR DEAL WITH WHICH IRAN WAS FULLY COMPLIANT SETTING OFF THE ESCALATION
Tamil-0004-8206	HIS PLAN WAS TO SQUEEZE THE IRANIAN ECONOMY AND FORCE TEHRAN BACK TO THE TABLE TO RENEGOTIATE THE NUCLEAR ISSUE AS WELL AS IRANS MISSILE PROGRAMME AND REGIONAL ACTIVISM FOR A BETTER DEAL
Tamil-0004-8207	A YEAR LATER THE USAND IRAN ARE ON THE BRINK OF A WAR
Tamil-0004-8208	THE PROBLEM WITH MRTRUMPS MAXIMUM PRESSURE APPROACH IS THAT HE DOESNT SEEM TO HAVE A PLAN BETWEEN THE SANCTIONSDRIVEN PRESSURE TACTICS AND A POTENTIAL MILITARY CONFLICT
Tamil-0004-8209	IRAN ON THE OTHER HAND IS READY TO TAKE LIMITED RISKS AS ITS ACTIONS SUCH AS THE THREAT TO BREACH THE URANIUM ENRICHMENT LIMITS SET BY THE NUCLEAR DEAL AND THE DOWNING OF THE AMERICAN DRONE SUGGEST TO BREAK THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE SANCTIONS
Tamil-0004-8210	AS A RESULT MRTRUMP HAS A SITUATION WHERE MAXIMUM PRESSURE IS NOT PRODUCING THE DESIRED RESULT AND BOTH COUNTRIES ARE EDGING TOWARDS A WAR HE DOESNT WANT
Tamil-0004-8211	A STORY TELLS THAT TWO FRIENDS WERE WALKING THROUGH THE DESERT DURING SOME POINT OF THE JOURNEY THEY HAD AN ARGUMENT AND ONE FRIEND SLAPPED THE OTHER ONE IN THE FACE
Tamil-0004-8212	THE ONE WHO GOT SLAPPED WAS HURT BUT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WROTE IN THE SAND
Tamil-0004-8213	TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE
Tamil-0004-8214	THEY KEPT ON WALKING UNTIL THEY FOUND AN OASIS WHERE THEY DECIDED TO TAKE A BATH 
Tamil-0004-8215	THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN SLAPPED GOT STUCK IN THE MIRE AND STARTED DROWNING BUT THE FRIEND SAVED HIM 
Tamil-0004-8216	AFTER HE RECOVERED FROM THE NEAR DROWNING HE WROTE ON A STONE
Tamil-0004-8217	TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE
Tamil-0004-8218	THE FRIEND WHO HAD SLAPPED AND SAVED HIS BEST FRIEND ASKED HIM
Tamil-0004-8219	AFTER I HURT YOU YOU WROTE IN THE SAND AND NOW YOU WRITE ON A STONE WHY
Tamil-0004-8220	THE OTHER FRIEND REPLIED
Tamil-0004-8221	WHEN SOMEONE HURTS US WE SHOULD WRITE IT DOWN IN SAND WHERE WINDS OF FORGIVENESS CAN ERASE IT AWAY BUT WHEN SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING GOOD FOR US WE MUST ENGRAVE IT IN STONE WHERE NO WIND CAN EVER ERASE IT
Tamil-0004-8222	MORAL OF THE STORY DONT VALUE THE THINGS YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE BUT VALUE WHO YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE

Tamil-0005-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0005-8223	THIS IS A STRATEGIC DILEMMA THAT WARRANTS A RECALIBRATION OF POLICY
Tamil-0005-8224	MRTRUMPS DECISION TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE AND THE NEW RED LINE HE SET FOR IRAN COULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH A RECALIBRATION
Tamil-0005-8225	HE COULD SEIZE THE MOMENT TO ASSURE IRAN THAT HIS PRIMARY GOAL IS ENGAGEMENT NOT CONFLICT
Tamil-0005-8226	WHAT IRAN WANTS THE MOST IS RELIEF FROM THE SANCTIONS
Tamil-0005-8227	INSTEAD OF STICKING TO A POLICY THAT HAS PROVED TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND RISKY MRTRUMP COULD OFFER TEHRAN SOME REPRIEVE IN RETURN FOR ITS REMAINING IN THE NUCLEAR DEAL WHICH COULD BE FOLLOWED UP BY A FRESH DIPLOMATIC OPENING
Tamil-0005-8228	IF HE CONTINUES WITH THE PRESSURE TACTICS TENSIONS WILL STAY HIGH THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ WOULD BE ON THE BRINK AND FURTHER PROVOCATIONS BY EITHER SIDE OR EVEN AN ACCIDENT COULD TRIGGER A FULLSCALE CONFLICT
Tamil-0005-8229	THAT IS A DANGEROUS SLOPE
Tamil-0005-8230	THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX COUNCILS FIRST MEETING UNDER THE NEW GOVERNMENT DID NOT DELIVER ANY BIG SURPRISES
Tamil-0005-8231	APART FROM SOME MINOR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES UNDER THE GST THE COUNCILS MEETING ON FRIDAY UNDER FINANCE MINISTER NIRMALA SITHARAMAN WAS LARGELY A LACKLUSTRE EVENT
Tamil-0005-8232	THERE WAS SOME EXPECTATION THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN TAX RATES ACROSS THE BOARD IN ORDER TO HELP SPUR CONSUMER DEMAND THAT HAS BEEN SAGGING IN RECENT QUARTERS
Tamil-0005-8233	BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENED
Tamil-0005-8234	THE MEETING ENDED WITH SOME CHANGES IN PROCEDURE THAT ARE EXPECTED TO TACKLE TAX EVASION AND MAKE GST FILING EASIER
Tamil-0005-8235	IN PARTICULAR AADHAAR HAS BEEN APPROVED AS SUFFICIENT PROOF TO OBTAIN GST REGISTRATION
Tamil-0005-8236	EVEN THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WOULD BE A CUT IN THE TAX IMPOSED ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES FROM TWELVE PERCENT TO FIVE PERCENT WAS NOT MET
Tamil-0005-8237	THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT THE REVENUE IMPLICATIONS OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ACROSSTHEBOARD TAX CUT
Tamil-0005-8238	ALTHOUGH GST COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS MONTHLY TAX COLLECTIONS HAVE LARGELY BEEN MODEST SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TAX REGIME IN MIDTWENTY SEVENTEEN FAILING TO MEET THE GOVERNMENTS OWN TARGETS MOST OF THE TIME
Tamil-0005-8239	BUT SUCH CAUTION MAY NOT HELP THE LARGER CAUSE OF THE ECONOMY WHICH URGENTLY NEEDS A BOOST IN SOME FORM
Tamil-0005-8240	A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN RATES COULD HAVE SENT OUT THE STRONG SIGNAL THAT THE NDA GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT PUSHING THROUGH SERIOUS PROGROWTH REFORMS DURING ITS SECOND TERM IN OFFICE
Tamil-0005-8241	ANOTHER NOTABLE DECISION TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL WAS THE ONE TO EXTEND THE TENURE OF THE NATIONAL ANTIPROFITEERING AUTHORITY BY TWO YEARS TILL NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTYONE
Tamil-0005-8242	FURTHER THE COUNCIL INCREASED THE QUANTUM OF PENALTY THAT COULD BE IMPOSED BY THE AUTHORITY ON PROFITEERING COMPANIES FROM THE CURRENT MAXIMUM OF RUPEES TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT OF THE PROFITEERED AMOUNT
Tamil-0005-8243	GIVEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED THE POWERS OF THE ANTIPROFITEERING BODY IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IF THE BODY BECOMES A PERMANENT FEATURE UNDER GST
Tamil-0005-8244	THIS DOES NOT SEND A PROMISING MESSAGE TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AHEAD OF THE UNION BUDGET SCHEDULED TO BE PRESENTED IN PARLIAMENT ON JULY FIVE 
Tamil-0005-8245	THE ANTIPROFITEERING CLAUSE ASSUMES THAT GOVERNMENT ACTION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PASS ON THE BENEFIT OF TAX CUTS TO CONSUMERS OR ELSE TAX CUTS MAY SIMPLY END UP ADDING TO THE PROFITS OF BUSINESSES
Tamil-0005-8246	THIS IS WRONG
Tamil-0005-8247	WHILE BUSINESSES NATURALLY TRY TO PROFIT FROM LOWER TAXES THE FORCES OF COMPETITION MAKE SURE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS ARE DRIVEN BACK DOWN TO NORMAL
Tamil-0005-8248	ONE NIGHT FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE OUT PARTYING LATE NIGHT AND DIDNT STUDY FOR THE TEST WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT DAY IN THE MORNING THEY THOUGHT OF A PLAN
Tamil-0005-8249	THEY MADE THEMSELVES LOOK DIRTY WITH GREASE AND DIRT
Tamil-0005-8250	THEN THEY WENT TO THE DEAN AND SAID THEY HAD GONE OUT TO A WEDDING LAST NIGHT AND ON THEIR WAY BACK THE TIRE OF THEIR CAR BURST AND THEY HAD TO PUSH THE CAR ALL THE WAY BACK 
Tamil-0005-8251	SO THEY WERE IN NO CONDITION TO TAKE THE TEST
Tamil-0005-8252	THE DEAN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE AND SAID THEY CAN HAVE THE RETEST AFTER 3 DAYS THEY THANKED HIM AND SAID THEY WILL BE READY BY THAT TIME
Tamil-0005-8253	ON THE THIRD DAY THEY APPEARED BEFORE THE DEAN THE DEAN SAID THAT AS THIS WAS A SPECIAL CONDITION TEST ALL FOUR WERE REQUIRED TO SIT IN SEPARATE CLASSROOMS FOR THE TEST THEY ALL AGREED AS THEY HAD PREPARED WELL IN THE LAST 3 DAYS
Tamil-0005-8254	THE TEST CONSISTED OF ONLY 2 QUESTIONS WITH THE TOTAL OF 100 POINTS
Tamil-0005-8255	MORAL OF THE STORY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR YOU WILL LEARN YOUR LESSON

Tamil-0006-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0006-8256	THE ALTERNATIVE OF HAVING A BUREAUCRACY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE MAKES PROFIT LOOK LIKE A BAD WORD AND ENCOURAGES RENTSEEKING BY CORRUPT AUTHORITIES
Tamil-0006-8257	PRESIDENT RAM NATH KOVINDS ADDRESS TO THE JOINT SITTING OF PARLIAMENT SET OUT THE PHILOSOPHY AND PRIORITIES OF THE NARENDRA MODI GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN REELECTED
Tamil-0006-8258	IT OUTLINED THE RUPTURE THAT HAS COME TO CHARACTERISE MRMODIS POLITICS MARKED BY HIS TWENTY FOURTEEN VICTORY AND POINTEDLY IGNORED THE PROGRESS INDIA HAD MADE DURING EARLIER YEARS
Tamil-0006-8259	THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WAS COMMITTED TO THAT VERY IDEA OF NATIONBUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR WHICH WAS LAID IN TWENTY FOURTEEN 
Tamil-0006-8260	HARNESSING THE THOUGHTS OF SOCIAL REFORMER SREE NARAYANA GURU AND RABINDRANATH TAGORE TO EMPHASISE BROTHERHOOD AMONG ALL SECTIONS AND THE CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPLIFTING IF ONLY THE REST OF THE SPEECH DWELT ON THOSE IDEAS IN SOME DETAIL AND WITH FORCE
Tamil-0006-8261	IN THE ABSENCE OF ELABORATION SUCH GRAND INTENT IN THE INITIAL PARAGRAPHS WAS NOT REASSURING
Tamil-0006-8262	THE PRIME MINISTERS NEWLY ADDED OBJECTIVE OF WINNING THE TRUST OF ALL GOVERNED SABKA VISHWAS WAS NOT FLESHED OUT MEANINGFULLY
Tamil-0006-8263	SARDAR PATEL BABASAHEB AMBEDKAR AND MAHATMA GANDHI FOUND MENTION BUT NOT JAWAHARLAL NEHRU THE FOUNDING PRIME MINISTER WHOSE VISION AND UNFAILING COMMITMENT TO SECULARISM PLURALISM AND PROGRESS SET THE REPUBLIC ON A SUSTAINABLE COURSE
Tamil-0006-8264	THE NEW INDIA THAT THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IS A DEPARTURE FROM THAT FOUNDING VISION AND THERE WAS NO AMBIGUITY ON THAT ASPECT
Tamil-0006-8265	HE STRUCK A CHORD WITH THE CONSTITUENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOT WITH ALL
Tamil-0006-8266	THE NOTION THAT THERE IS A NONSECTARIAN DEVELOPMENT AGENDA THAT IS IMPERVIOUS TO IDENTITY POLITICS IS GOOD TO HAVE AND THE PRIME MINISTERS EVANGELICAL FERVOUR IN DRIVING ITS SCHEMES IS LAUDABLE
Tamil-0006-8267	BUT TRIUMPHALISM AROUND MANY SCHEMES SUCH AS THE SWACHH BHARAT MISSION HAS DEFLECTED PUBLIC ATTENTION FROM THE SERIOUS TASKS AHEAD AND AN HONEST DISCUSSION ON ACHIEVEMENTS
Tamil-0006-8268	NEW FOCUS ON WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT AND THE RURAL ECONOMY IS NOT A MOMENT TOO EARLY
Tamil-0006-8269	THESE ARE CRITICAL AREAS
Tamil-0006-8270	MRKOVIND ALSO SPOKE OF THE GOVERNMENTS INTENT TO EXPAND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HIGHER EDUCATION
Tamil-0006-8271	A SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT IS SIGNIFICANT NOT FOR THE TECHNICAL DETAILS IT OFFERS BUT FOR THE VISION
Tamil-0006-8272	THE CULTURAL NATIONALIST AGENDA OF THE RULING DISPENSATION THAT HAS MADE INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY DANGEROUS IN INDIA IS NOT THE ROUTE TO ANY OF THESE GOALS
Tamil-0006-8273	THE RESTRICTIONS ON CATTLE TRADE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST THOSE EMPLOYED IN IT  MOSTLY MUSLIMS AND DALITS  HAVE NOT MERELY BECOME A PROTRACTED COMMUNAL CONFLICT BUT ARE ALSO AMONG THE FACTORS THAT HAVE PUSHED THE RURAL ECONOMY OFF THE RAILS
Tamil-0006-8274	ANNOUNCING YET ANOTHER SCHEME FOR CATTLE AS THE PRESIDENT DID IS NOT CONFRONTING THE REAL SELFINFLICTED PROBLEM
Tamil-0006-8275	WHAT DIFFERENTIATES ONE DISPENSATION FROM ANOTHER IS NOT THE MATERIAL AMBITIONS BUT THE SOCIAL PURPOSE AND DIRECTION OF SUCH PURSUITS
Tamil-0006-8276	THE CLARITY ON THAT ASPECT IN THE ADDRESS MAY BE STIMULATING FOR MANY BUT CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR INDIA
Tamil-0006-8277	THE KEY MESSAGE FROM THE UNS WORLD POPULATION PROSPECTS TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT IS THAT NATIONAL LEADERS MUST REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS TO RAISE EDUCATION HEALTH AND LIVING STANDARDS FOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
Tamil-0006-8278	INDIA IS PROJECTED TO BECOME THE MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY BY TWENTY TWENTYSEVEN SURPASSING CHINA AND HOST TWO BILLION PEOPLE BY TWENTY FIFTY THE WORLD AS A WHOLE COULD BE HOME TO EIGHT BILLION PEOPLE IN JUST OVER A DECADE FROM NOW AND THE NUMBER COULD GO UP TO NINE BILLION BY MIDCENTURY
Tamil-0006-8279	THE PROJECTIONS SHOULD BE VIEWED IN PERSPECTIVE CONSIDERING THAT ALARMIST MALTHUSIAN FEARS OF INABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN A BILLION PEOPLE ON EARTH DID NOT COME TRUE
Tamil-0006-8280	YET THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF STABILISING POPULATION NUMBERS BY RAISING THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE AND ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL NOT DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT
Tamil-0006-8281	IT WAS AN INCREDIBLY HOT DAY AND A LION WAS FEELING VERY HUNGRY
Tamil-0006-8282	HE CAME OUT OF HIS DEN AND SEARCHED HERE AND THERE HE COULD FIND ONLY A SMALL HARE 
Tamil-0006-8283	HE CAUGHT THE HARE WITH SOME HESITATION THIS HARE CANT FILL MY STOMACH THOUGHT THE LION
Tamil-0006-8284	AS THE LION WAS ABOUT TO KILL THE HARE A DEER RAN THAT WAY THE LION BECAME GREEDY HE THOUGHT
Tamil-0006-8285	INSTEAD OF EATING THIS SMALL HARE LET ME EAT THE BIG DEER
Tamil-0006-8286	HE LET THE HARE GO AND WENT BEHIND THE DEER BUT THE DEER HAD VANISHED INTO THE FOREST 
Tamil-0006-8287	THE LION NOW FELT SORRY FOR LETTING THE HARE OFF
Tamil-0006-8288	MORAL OF THE STORY A BIRD IN HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH

Tamil-0007-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0007-8289	THE UN REPORT SHOWS MIGRATION TO COUNTRIES WITH A FALLING RATIO OF WORKINGAGE PEOPLE TO THOSE ABOVE SIXTY FIVE WILL BE STEADY AS THOSE ECONOMIES OPEN UP TO WORKERS TO SUSTAIN ECONOMIC PRODUCTION
Tamil-0007-8290	JAPAN HAS THE LOWEST SUCH RATIO FOLLOWED BY EUROPE AND THE CARIBBEAN IN OVER THREE DECADES NORTH AMERICA EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN ASIA WILL JOIN THIS GROUP
Tamil-0007-8291	INDIA MEANWHILE WILL HAVE A VAST NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND INSUFFICIENT NATURAL RESOURCES LEFT FOR EXPLOITATION
Tamil-0007-8292	PREPARING FOR THE CHANGES AND OPPORTUNITIES MIGRATION OFFERS WILL DEPEND ON A SKILLS REVOLUTION
Tamil-0007-8293	AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ACHIEVING A REDUCTION IN FERTILITY RATES IN STATES SUCH AS BIHAR UTTAR PRADESH HARYANA MADHYA PRADESH JHARKHAND AND CHHATTISGARH  WHICH ARE HIGH AS PER SAMPLE REGISTRATION SYSTEM DATA  IS A CHALLENGE FOR INDIA AS IT SEEKS TO STABILISE POPULATION GROWTH
Tamil-0007-8294	THIS IS POSSIBLE IF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS SET THEIR MINDS TO IT
Tamil-0007-8295	THEY MUST SINGULARLY FOCUS ON IMPROVING EDUCATION AND HEALTH ACCESS FOR WOMEN BOTH OF WHICH WILL HELP THEM BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED
Tamil-0007-8296	ON THE OTHER HAND A RISE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY HAS BROUGHT WITH IT A POLICY IMPERATIVE THAT IS BOUND TO BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN COMING DECADES
Tamil-0007-8297	A GROWING POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS IS A CERTAINTY AND IT OPENS UP PROSPECTS FOR EMPLOYMENT IN MANY NEW SERVICES CATERING TO THEM
Tamil-0007-8298	URBAN FACILITIES HAVE TO BE REIMAGINED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ACCESS TO GOOD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MOBILITY
Tamil-0007-8299	THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A ROADMAP TO THIS NEW ERA
Tamil-0007-8300	BUT PROGRESS IN POVERTY REDUCTION GREATER EQUALITY BETTER NUTRITION UNIVERSAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS STATE SUPPORT AND STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS
Tamil-0007-8301	MAKING AGRICULTURE REMUNERATIVE AND KEEPING FOOD PRICES STABLE ARE CRUCIAL TO ENSURE NUTRITION FOR ALL
Tamil-0007-8302	INDIA IS SET TO BECOME THE MOST POPULOUS NATION
Tamil-0007-8303	FOR ITS LEADERS IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ITS PEOPLE WILL BE A TEST OF POLITICAL WILL
Tamil-0007-8304	THE DECISION TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE ISSUE OF HOLDING SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS TO THE LOK SABHA AND THE STATE ASSEMBLIES IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ACHIEVING PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODIS OBJECTIVE OF SYNCHRONISING ELECTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
Tamil-0007-8305	THE FACT THAT HE TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO CONVENE A MEETING OF LEADERS OF ALL POLITICAL PARTIES SO EARLY IN HIS SECOND STINT IN OFFICE SHOWS THAT HE ATTACHES CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO IT
Tamil-0007-8306	ADVOCATES OF SUCH ELECTIONS POINT TO POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Tamil-0007-8307	THERE IS THE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGE OF CURBING THE HUGE EXPENDITURE INVOLVED AND REDUCING THE BURDEN ON THE MANPOWER DEPLOYED
Tamil-0007-8308	THE SECOND POINT IN ITS FAVOUR IS THAT RULING PARTIES CAN FOCUS MORE ON GOVERNANCE AND LESS ON CAMPAIGNING
Tamil-0007-8309	THE IDEA THAT SOME PART OF THE COUNTRY IS IN ELECTION MODE EVERY YEAR RESULTING IN IMPEDIMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT WORK DUE TO THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT BEING IN FORCE IS CITED IN FAVOUR OF REDUCING ELECTION FREQUENCY
Tamil-0007-8310	BUT THERE ARE CHALLENGING QUESTIONS OF FEASIBILITY THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM MUST CONTEND WITH
Tamil-0007-8311	FIRST IT MAY REQUIRE THE CURTAILMENT OR EXTENSION OF THE TENURE OF STATE LEGISLATURES TO BRING THEIR ELECTIONS IN LINE WITH THE LOK SABHA POLL DATES
Tamil-0007-8312	SHOULD STATE GOVERNMENTS BEAR THIS BURDEN JUST TO FULFIL THE IDEAL OF SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS THERE IS AN OBVIOUS LACK OF POLITICAL CONSENSUS ON THIS
Tamil-0007-8313	ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT AT THE CENTRE FALLS
Tamil-0007-8314	VIJAY AND RAJU WERE FRIENDS ON A HOLIDAY THEY WENT WALKING INTO A FOREST ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF NATURE 
Tamil-0007-8315	SUDDENLY THEY SAW A BEAR COMING AT THEM THEY BECAME FRIGHTENED
Tamil-0007-8316	RAJU WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT CLIMBING TREES RAN UP TO A TREE AND CLIMBED UP QUICKLY 
Tamil-0007-8317	HE DIDNT THINK OF VIJAY VIJAY HAD NO IDEA HOW TO CLIMB THE TREE

Tamil-0008-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0008-8322	THE LAW COMMISSION IN ITS WORKING PAPER ON THE SUBJECT HAS MOOTED THE IDEA OF A CONSTRUCTIVE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE
Tamil-0008-8323	THAT IS WHILE EXPRESSING LOSS OF TRUST IN ONE GOVERNMENT MEMBERS SHOULD REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN AN ALTERNATIVE REGIME
Tamil-0008-8324	ANOTHER IDEA IS THAT WHENEVER MIDTERM POLLS ARE HELD DUE TO LOSS OF MAJORITY THE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATURE SHOULD SERVE OUT ONLY THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM
Tamil-0008-8325	THESE MEASURES WOULD INVOLVE FARREACHING CHANGES TO THE LAW INCLUDING AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION TO ALTER THE TENURE OF LEGISLATURES AND THE PROVISION FOR DISQUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS FOR SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE REGIME
Tamil-0008-8326	IN TERMS OF PRINCIPLE THE MAIN ISSUE IS WHETHER GETTING ALL ELECTIONS TO COINCIDE UNDERMINES REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND FEDERALISM
Tamil-0008-8327	IN A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY THE EXECUTIVE IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ITS LEGITIMACY WOULD BE UNDERMINED BY TAKING AWAY THE LEGISLATURES POWER TO BRING DOWN A MINORITY REGIME BY MANDATING A FIXED TENURE JUST TO HAVE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS
Tamil-0008-8328	THE INTERESTS OF REGIONAL PARTIES MAY TAKE A BEATING AS REGIONAL ISSUES MAY BE SUBSUMED BY NATIONAL THEMES IN A COMMON ELECTION
Tamil-0008-8329	GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES THERE IS SIMPLY NO CASE FOR HASTENING THE INTRODUCTION OF SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS
Tamil-0008-8330	THE GOVERNMENT MUST ACCORD PRIORITY TO OTHER ELECTORAL REFORMSFOR INSTANCE IT SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO CURB SPENDING BY CANDIDATES AND PARTIES WHICH HAS REACHED ALARMINGLY HIGH LEVELS AND POSES A THREAT TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS
Tamil-0008-8331	NONBANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES ALREADY REELING UNDER A PAINFUL LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE UP AGAINST A FRESH CHALLENGE IN THE FORM OF NEW REGULATORY NORMS SET BY THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA
Tamil-0008-8332	THE CENTRAL BANK HAS RELEASED DRAFT NORMS ON LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FOR DEPOSIT TAKING AND NONDEPOSIT TAKING NBFCS
Tamil-0008-8333	ACCORDING TO THESE PROPOSED RULES NBFCS WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH A HIGHER LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO LCR WHICH IS THE PROPORTION OF ASSETS THAT AN NBFC NEEDS TO HOLD IN THE FORM OF HIGHQUALITY LIQUID ASSETS THAT CAN BE QUICKLY AND EASILY CONVERTED INTO CASH
Tamil-0008-8334	THE NEW NORMS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE RBI OVER FOUR YEARS STARTING FROM APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WOULD LIKELY PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE MARGINS OF NBFCS
Tamil-0008-8335	UNDER THESE NORMS NBFCS WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN THEIR LCR AT SIXTY PERCENT OF NET CASH OUTFLOWS INITIALLY AND IMPROVE IT TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTYFOUR
Tamil-0008-8336	IF THE NORMS ARE IMPLEMENTED NBFCS MAY BE FORCED TO PARK A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THEIR MONEY IN LOWRISK LIQUID ASSETS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT BONDS WHICH YIELD MUCH LOWER RETURNS THAN HIGHRISK ILLIQUID ASSETS
Tamil-0008-8337	THE STRICT NORMS HAVE TO BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRESENT CRISIS WHERE EVEN PROMINENT NBFCS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO VARIOUS LENDERS
Tamil-0008-8338	WHILE THE PROFIT OUTLOOK AND OTHER SHORTTERM FINANCIAL METRICS OF NBFCS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE NORMS THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR LONGTERM IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF NBFCS AND THE WIDER FINANCIAL SECTOR
Tamil-0008-8339	NBFCS WHICH ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF BORROWING SHORT TERM TO LEND LONG TERM TYPICALLY RUN THE RISK OF BEING UNABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR BORROWERS ON TIME DUE TO A MISMATCH IN THE DURATION OF THEIR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Tamil-0008-8340	THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO IN INSTANCES WHERE PANIC SETS IN AMONG SHORTTERM LENDERS AS HAPPENED LAST YEAR WHEN LENDERS WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CAPITAL DEMANDED TO BE PAID BACK IN FULL
Tamil-0008-8341	IN OTHER WORDS NBFCS RELY HEAVILY ON SHORTTERM LENDERS ROLLING OVER THEIR LOANS WITHOUT FAIL IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY KIND OF LIQUIDITY CRISIS
Tamil-0008-8342	THE NEW NORMS WOULD DISCOURAGE NBFCS FROM BORROWING OVER SHORT TERM TO EXTEND LONGTERM LOANS WITHOUT THE NECESSARY BUFFER CAPITAL IN PLACE
Tamil-0008-8343	THIS COULD COMPEL NBFCS TO SHRINK THE SCOPE OF THEIR LENDING FROM WHAT IT IS TODAY BUT IT WOULD SAVE THEM FROM LARGER CRISES AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NEED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OR THE RBI TO STEP IN AS THE LENDER OF LAST RESORT
Tamil-0008-8344	UNDENIABLY NBFCS HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB IN RECENT YEARS IN WIDENING AND DEEPENING ACCESS TO CREDIT BY TAKING A SHARE FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE BAD LOANS CRISIS
Tamil-0008-8345	HOWEVER THE LATEST LIQUIDITY NORMS FOR NBFCS ARE STILL NECESSARY TO WARD OFF SYSTEMIC CRISES

Tamil-0008-8347	ONCE UPON A TIME A DAUGHTER COMPLAINED TO HER FATHER THAT HER LIFE WAS MISERABLE AND THAT SHE DIDNT KNOW HOW SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT
Tamil-0008-8348	SHE WAS TIRED OF FIGHTING AND STRUGGLING ALL THE TIME IT SEEMED JUST AS ONE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED ANOTHER ONE SOON FOLLOWED
Tamil-0008-8349	HER FATHER A CHEF TOOK HER TO THE KITCHEN HE FILLED THREE POTS WITH WATER AND PLACED EACH ON A HIGH FIRE
Tamil-0008-8350	ONCE THE THREE POTS BEGAN TO BOIL HE PLACED POTATOES IN ONE POT EGGS IN THE SECOND POT AND GROUND COFFEE BEANS IN THE THIRD POT HE THEN LET THEM SIT AND BOIL WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HIS DAUGHTER
Tamil-0008-8351	THE DAUGHTER MOANED AND IMPATIENTLY WAITED WONDERING WHAT HE WAS DOING AFTER TWENTY MINUTES HE TURNED OFF THE BURNERS
Tamil-0008-8352	HE TOOK THE POTATOES OUT OF THE POT AND PLACED THEM IN A BOWL HE PULLED THE EGGS OUT AND PLACED THEM IN A BOWL 
Tamil-0008-8353	HE THEN LADLED THE COFFEE OUT AND PLACED IT IN A CUP
Tamil-0008-8354	TURNING TO HER HE ASKED DAUGHTER WHAT DO YOU SEE
Tamil-0008-8355	POTATOES EGGS AND COFFEE SHE HASTILY REPLIED
Tamil-0008-8356	LOOK CLOSER HE SAID AND TOUCH THE POTATOES SHE DID AND NOTED THAT THEY WERE SOFT
Tamil-0008-8357	HE THEN ASKED HER TO TAKE AN EGG AND BREAK IT AFTER PULLING OFF THE SHELL SHE OBSERVED THE HARDBOILED EGG
Tamil-0008-8358	FINALLY HE ASKED HER TO SIP THE COFFEE ITS RICH AROMA BROUGHT A SMILE TO HER FACE
Tamil-0008-8359	FATHER WHAT DOES THIS MEAN SHE ASKED
Tamil-0008-8360	HE THEN EXPLAINED THAT THE POTATOES THE EGGS AND COFFEE BEANS HAD EACH FACED THE SAME ADVERSITYTHE BOILING WATER HOWEVER EACH ONE REACTED DIFFERENTLY THE POTATO WENT IN STRONG HARD AND UNRELENTING BUT IN BOILING WATER IT BECAME SOFT AND WEAK
Tamil-0008-8361	THE EGG WAS FRAGILE WITH THE THIN OUTER SHELL PROTECTING ITS LIQUID INTERIOR UNTIL IT WAS PUT IN THE BOILING WATER THEN THE INSIDE OF THE EGG BECAME HARD
Tamil-0008-8362	HOWEVER THE GROUND COFFEE BEANS WERE UNIQUE AFTER THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE BOILING WATER THEY CHANGED THE WATER AND CREATED SOMETHING NEW
Tamil-0008-8363	WHICH ONE ARE YOU HE ASKED HIS DAUGHTER
Tamil-0008-8364	WHEN ADVERSITY KNOCKS ON YOUR DOOR HOW DO YOU RESPOND ARE YOU A POTATO AN EGG OR A COFFEE BEAN
Tamil-0008-8365	MORAL OF THE STORY IN LIFE THINGS HAPPEN AROUND US THINGS HAPPEN TO US BUT THE ONLY THING THAT TRULY MATTERS IS HOW YOU CHOOSE TO REACT TO IT AND WHAT YOU MAKE OUT OF IT

Tamil-0013-8505	WHAT CAME AS A SURPRISE IS THE INDICATION THAT HE WAS SEEMINGLY UNMOVED BY THE CWC RESOLUTION THAT URGED HIM TO CONTINUE AS PRESIDENT AND RESTRUCTURE THE PARTY
Tamil-0013-8506	EITHER WAY WHETHER MRGANDHI FINALLY INSISTS ON QUITTING OR ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED OTHERWISE THE PARTY CANNOT LOOK AWAY FROM A DILEMMA THAT HAS SHADOWED IT FOR LONG THE DOUBLEEDGED SWORD OF THE DYNASTY
Tamil-0013-8507	DEVOID OF A COHERENT IDEOLOGY OR ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THE NEHRUGANDHI DYNASTY HAS REMAINED THE PARTYS CEMENTING GLUE
Tamil-0013-8508	THE FAMILY IS PROJECTED AS THE PARTYS EMOTIONAL CURRENCY WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE GANDHI SURNAME IS INVOKED TO HARK BACK TO THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF MODERN INDIA
Tamil-0013-8509	HOWEVER NOW IN TWENTY NINETEEN FACING ITS TOUGHEST CRISIS THE CONGRESS MUST ADDRESS THE QUESTION UNFLINCHINGLY AND IN DEPTH IF IT IS TO REFRESH ITSELF AS A POLITICAL FORCE
Tamil-0013-8510	THE DECLINE OF THE CONGRESS IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE FADING APPEAL OF THE OLD WAYS OF CONDUCTING POLITICS AND OF THE DISENCHANTMENT WITH OPAQUE AND UNACCOUNTABLE POWERWIELDING BY POLITICAL DYNASTIES
Tamil-0013-8511	ALSO AS WITH THE LEFT AND MANDAL PARTIES THE CONGRESS HAS COLLECTIVELY FAILED TO UPGRADE ITS MESSAGE MODES OF OUTREACH AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES
Tamil-0013-8512	BUT THE CONGRESSS SUCCESS IN NIMBLY FACING UP TO THE ROUT IS VITAL IF INDIA IS TO HAVE A COHERENT POLITICAL OPPOSITION THAT KEEPS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE
Tamil-0013-8513	OF COURSE CONGRESS LEADERS ARGUE THAT THE PARTY WOULD DISINTEGRATE IF MRGANDHI WERE TO QUIT
Tamil-0013-8514	MRGANDHI WHO HAD ONCE LIKENED POWER TO POISON MUST TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS PARTYS DEBACLE

Tamil-0013-8516	WHETHER MRGANDHI STICKS TO HIS RESOLVE TO QUIT OR NOT THE PARTY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF REVITALISATION THAT DEALS WITH THE HOLLOWING OUT OF ITS INTRAPARTY DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0013-8517	ANY ORGANISATIONAL REFORM THAT DOES NOT DECENTRALISE DECISIONMAKING AND FIX ACCOUNTABILITY AT ALL LEVELS IS BOUND TO FAIL
Tamil-0013-8518	IT MUST INVOLVE A FRANK ASSESSMENT OF THE CONGRESSS RISK OF FAILING TO COHERE IF MRGANDHI WERE TO ABRUPTLY LEAVE HIS POST AS PARTY PRESIDENT
Tamil-0013-8519	TRUE THE CONGRESS MAY WELL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ITSELF WITHOUT A DYNAST

Tamil-0014-8535	NEITHER HAS PROLONGED AGGRESSIVE LITIGATION BY THE AFFECTED FAMILIES IN THE UPHAAR CASE MADE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THE CRIMINAL CULPABILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY AND OFFICIALS WHO SANCTIONED UNSAFE BUILDINGS OFTEN IN RETURN FOR BRIBES REMAINS LARGELY UNADDRESSED
Tamil-0014-8536	THE SURAT FIRE CANNOT BE CALLED AN ACCIDENT SINCE THERE ARE REPORTS OF NOTICES HAVING BEEN SERVED TO THE BUILDER ON THE RISKS BUT NOT PURSUED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
Tamil-0014-8537	CIVIC OFFICIALS HAVE DISPLAYED UNFORGIVABLE INDIFFERENCE SINCE TWO DEATHS OCCURRED IN ANOTHER COACHING CENTRE IN THE CITY LATE LAST YEAR
Tamil-0014-8538	THAT TRAGEDY SHOULD HAVE LED TO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS
Tamil-0014-8539	THE PRESENT INQUIRY INTO THE DISASTER SHOULD GO INTO ANY DEVIATIONS FROM THE SANCTIONED PLAN FOR THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING HOUSING THE COACHING CENTRE AND THE ROLE OF URBAN PLANNING OFFICIALS IN ALLOWING IT TO COME UP
Tamil-0014-8540	ULTIMATELY LITIGATION ON FIRE DISASTERS GOES TO THE COURTS AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE JUDICIARY TO SEND OUT THE MESSAGE THAT THERE WILL BE NO TOLERANCE TO CORRUPTION AND EVASION IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF BUILDING RULES AND FIRE SAFETY
Tamil-0014-8541	BEYOND SUSPENDING A FEW OFFICIALS AND FILING CASES AGAINST THE BUILDING OWNERS THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF SANCTIONING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES

Tamil-0014-8543	MANDATING COMPULSORY INSURANCE FOR ALL PUBLIC BUILDINGS AGAINST FIRE RISK AND PUBLIC LIABILITY CAN BRING ABOUT A CHANGE TO THE WAY ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS APPROACH THE QUESTION OF SAFETY SINCE THE INSURER WOULD REQUIRE A REDUCTION OF RISK AND COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING PLANS

Tamil-0016-8596	THE WELFARE SCHEMES OF THE MODI GOVERNMENT DID PLAY A ROLE BUT THESE OR THE PROMISE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WERE NOT THE REAL DIFFERENTIATORS
Tamil-0016-8597	THE PULWAMA TERRORIST STRIKE AND INDIAS RESPONSE TO IT DOVETAILED INTO THE BJPS CAMPAIGN
Tamil-0016-8598	AND THE VICTORY OF A TERROR ACCUSED IN BHOPAL CONSTITUENCY WHO HAILED THE ASSASSIN OF GANDHI AS A PATRIOT STOOD OUT AS A STRIKING REITERATION OF HINDUTVA
Tamil-0016-8599	SOUTHERN STATES BARRING KARNATAKA REMAINED UNIMPRESSED BY HINDUTVA BUT THE BJP MADE IMPRESSIVE INROADS IN WEST BENGAL AND ODISHA PROVING ITS POTENCY EVEN IN AREAS WHERE LINGUISTIC POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNFAVOURABLE TO IT
Tamil-0016-8600	TAMIL NADU WHERE DRAVIDIAN POLITICS HAD ENTRENCHED ITSELF AS A COUNTER TO HOMOGENISING PRESSURES DECADES AGO STONEWALLED THE BJP YET AGAIN AS DID KERALA
Tamil-0016-8601	BUT THE BJPS GAINS IN TELANGANA MODEST AS THEY ARE MIGHT BE AN INDICATOR THAT THE SOUTH MAY NOT REMAIN IMPERVIOUS TO IT FOREVER
Tamil-0016-8602	FOR THE PRESENT THE VICTORIES OF THE BIJU JANATA DAL IN ODISHA WHICH WON A FIFTH TERM AND THE YSR CONGRESS PARTY IN ANDHRA PRADESH ARE INDICATIVE THAT LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL IDENTITIES STILL CONTINUE TO HOLD SWAY IN THESE STATES
Tamil-0016-8603	PUNJAB WAS ALSO AN OUTLIER AS THE SIKHMAJORITY STATE LEANED TOWARDS THE CONGRESS
Tamil-0016-8604	TO URGE THE BJP TO UPHOLD SECULAR IDEALS OR TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF EXISTING INSTITUTIONS MAY AMOUNT TO DEMANDING AN ABANDONMENT OF ITS VERY CORE BELIEFS
Tamil-0016-8605	GAINING THE TRUST OF ALL CITIZENS WILL BE A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE FOR MRMODI TO DRIVE INDIAS CONTINUING JOURNEY TO BECOME A GLOBAL LEADER
Tamil-0016-8606	IT IS ONLY REASONABLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER BE ASKED TO LIVE UP TO THE PROMISE THEY CONTINUOUSLY MAKE  SABKA SAATH SABKA VIKAS WITH ALL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL
Tamil-0016-8607	THESE TENETS MUST BE FELT IN THE DAILY LIVES OF THE MARGINALISED SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION AND MRMODI MUST ADD A THIRD TENET TO MAKE HIS MANTRA MEANINGFUL SABKA VISHWAS THE TRUST OF ALL
Tamil-0016-8608	THE HINDU HOPES THAT MRMODIS SECOND TERM WILL BE MORE INCLUSIVE THAN THE FIRST WHICH WAS MARRED BY ARROGANT PRIDE AND HATEFUL PREJUDICE
Tamil-0016-8609	WE EXTEND OUR CONGRATULATIONS AND WISHES TO HIM AND HIS PARTY
Tamil-0016-8610	WITH THE SUCCESSFUL PREDAWN LAUNCH OF RISAT TWO B SATELLITE ON MAY TWENTY TWO  THE INDIAN SPACE RESEARCH ORGANISATION ISRO HAS ADDED ANOTHER FEATHER TO ITS CAP
Tamil-0016-8611	THE SATELLITE WILL ENHANCE INDIAS CAPABILITY IN CROP MONITORING DURING THE MONSOON SEASON FORESTRY MAPPING FOR FOREST FIRES AND DEFORESTATION AND FLOOD MAPPING AS PART OF THE NATIONAL DISASTER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME
Tamil-0016-8612	GIVEN THAT OVERCAST SKIES ARE A CONSTANT DURING THE MONSOON SEASON AND DURING TIMES OF FLOOD THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE CLOUD COVER IS ESSENTIAL
Tamil-0016-8613	WHILE OPTICAL REMOTE SENSING THAT RELIES ON VISIBLE LIGHT FOR IMAGING GETS OBSTRUCTED BY CLOUDS RISAT TWO B WILL NOT
Tamil-0016-8614	MUCH LIKE THE RISATONE SATELLITE THAT WAS LAUNCHED BY ISRO IN APRIL TWENTY TWELVE RISAT TWO B WILL ALSO USE MICROWAVE RADIATION
Tamil-0016-8615	UNLIKE VISIBLE LIGHT MICROWAVES HAVE LONGER WAVELENGTH AND SO WILL NOT BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATMOSPHERIC SCATTERING
Tamil-0016-8616	IDEAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE AMBITIOUS HOW ELSE DO YOU LIVE YOUR DREAM LIFE AND NOT JUST AN AVERAGE ONE
Tamil-0016-8617	BUT PEOPLE COME UP WITH THESE AMAZING YET INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS IDEAS AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THEY TELL THEMSELVES THAT ITS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE AND THERES NO POINT IN TAKING THE ACTION NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE DREAMS AND DESIRES
Tamil-0016-8618	THERES NO SUCH THING AS AN IDEA THATS TOO AMBITIOUS 
Tamil-0016-8619	ITS JUST GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE
Tamil-0016-8620	LOOK AT ALL THE CRAZY INVENTIONS OVER THE YEARS THAT WE NOW TAKE FOR GRANTED 
Tamil-0016-8621	SOMEBODY HAD A DREAM TO BE ABLE TO FLY AND SO THEY SET TO WORK BUILDING THE AIRPLANE 
Tamil-0016-8622	BACK THEN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SET THAT THE DREAM TO FLY WAS AN ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS ONE 
Tamil-0016-8623	YET SOMEONE MADE THEIR HIGHLY AMBITIOUS IDEA BECOME A REALITY
Tamil-0016-8624	I DONT CARE WHAT YOURE IDEA MAY BE LIMITS ARE BEING BROKEN EVERY DAY BY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD 
Tamil-0016-8625	ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO RULE YOURSELF OUT RIGHT FROM THE OFF
Tamil-0018-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE
Tamil-0018-0001	THE CLUMSY CUSTOMER SPILLED SOME EXPENSIVE PERFUME 
Tamil-0018-0002	GRAND AUTO SLID THREE TO FIFTEEN AND ONE EIGHTH ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE 
Tamil-0018-0003	THE COMPANY WHICH RUNS RETAIL AUTOMOTIVE STORES TOLD SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISER TO TERMINATE DISCUSSIONS TO SELL THE FIRM 
Tamil-0018-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0018-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0018-8662	THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE DIED DUE TO DISEASE POOR HEALTH CARE AND MALNUTRITION
Tamil-0018-8663	THE BLOCKADE SAUDI ARABIA IMPOSED ON YEMEN STEADILY WORSENED THE COUNTRYS HUNGER PROBLEM AND HEALTHCARE CRISIS
Tamil-0018-8664	THE COUNTRY IS ON THE BRINK OF A FAMINE
Tamil-0018-8665	ITS A SHAME THAT EVEN WHEN THE CEASEFIRE WAS HOLDING THE SAUDIS DID NOT HALT BOMBING YEMEN
Tamil-0018-8666	SAUDI ARABIA APPEARS TO BE FRUSTRATED THAT IT IS NOT ABLE TO DEFEAT THE HOUTHIS EVEN AFTER YEARS OF HEAVY BOMBING
Tamil-0018-8667	THE HOUTHIS ON THEIR PART CONTINUE TO PROVOKE THE SAUDIS THROUGH CROSSBORDER ROCKET AND DRONE ATTACKS
Tamil-0018-8668	THE YEMENIS ARE STUCK IN BETWEEN
Tamil-0018-8669	THE WAY FORWARD IS THE HODEIDA MODEL
Tamil-0018-8670	THE DECEMBER CEASEFIRE TOOK EFFECT IN THE RED SEA PORT CITY AND BOTH THE REBELS AND GOVERNMENT FORCES STUCK TO IT TILL THE REBELS PULLED OUT LAST WEEK
Tamil-0018-8671	THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TALKS UNDER INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION AND REPLICATE THE HODEIDA MODEL ELSEWHERE IN YEMEN
Tamil-0018-8672	FOR THIS TO BE ACHIEVED THE HOUTHIS SHOULD DECOUPLE THEMSELVES FROM THE REGIONAL POLITICS AND STAY FOCUSSED ON RESOLVING DIFFERENCES WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND REBUILDING THE WARTORN COUNTRY WHILE SAUDI ARABIA SHOULD GET OUT OF YEMEN
Tamil-0018-8673	AS INDIA AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF THE ANNUAL SUMMER MONSOON HOPES ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH FOR NORMAL RAINFALL THAT IS SO VITAL FOR AGRICULTURE THE HEALTH OF FORESTS RIVERS AND WETLANDS
Tamil-0018-8674	THE INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT HAS FORECAST NORMAL RAINFALL OF NINETY SIX PERCENT OF THE LONG PERIOD AVERAGE OF EIGHTY NINE CM RAIN WITH AN ONSET DATE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE IN KERALA
Tamil-0018-8675	IT HAS ALSO SIGNALLED A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY OF A DEFICIT
Tamil-0018-8676	THE MONSOON BOUNTY IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SIXTY PERCENT OF GROSS CROPPED AREA IN FARMING THAT IS RAINFED AND REPRESENTS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FARMERS FOURTY FIVE PERCENT OF AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT
Tamil-0018-8677	GIVEN THE ERRATIC PATTERNS OF RAINFALL WITNESSED OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES AND THEIR POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO ATMOSPHERIC CHANGES CAUSED BY A VARIETY OF POLLUTANTS THE DISTRIBUTION OF MONSOON TWENTY NINETEEN WILL ADD TO THE INSIGHTS
Tamil-0018-8678	THE SOUTHWEST MONSOON IS A DETERMINANT OF INDIAS OVERALL PROSPERITY AND SUSTAINED EFFORTS TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF RAINFALL ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT FOR FARMS CITIES AND INDUSTRY
Tamil-0018-8679	CONSIDERING THAT THERE HAS BEEN A FIFTY TWO PERCENT DECLINE IN GROUNDWATER LEVELS BASED ON TESTS CONDUCTED LAST YEAR OVER THE PREVIOUS DECADAL AVERAGE STATE GOVERNMENTS SHOULD HAVE PURSUED THE SETTING UP OF NEW RECHARGING WELLS AND MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING ONES ON A WAR FOOTING
Tamil-0018-8680	THEY ALSO HAVE LAGGED IN BUILDING STRUCTURES TO HARVEST SURFACE WATER AND HELPING FARMERS RAISE THE EFFICIENCY OF IRRIGATION
Tamil-0018-8681	THE APPROACH TO THE FARMING SECTOR HOWEVER HAS BEEN INFLUENCED MORE BY THE IMPERATIVES OF AN ELECTION YEAR AND THE CENTRES BIGGEST INTERVENTION WAS TO ANNOUNCE A CASH HANDOUT TO SPECIFIED CATEGORIES OF SMALL FARMERS
Tamil-0018-8682	A NORMAL SUMMER MONSOON OVER THE SUBCONTINENT BRINGS WIDESPREAD PROSPERITY BUT DOES NOT GUARANTEE A UNIFORM SPREAD
Tamil-0018-8683	THIS AS SCIENTISTS POINT OUT MAY BE DUE TO THE EFFECT OF PARTICULATES RELEASED THROUGH VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL PROCESSES
Tamil-0018-8684	SOME OF THESE AEROSOLS SUPPRESS THE RAINFALL AND DISPERSE IT ACROSS THE LAND CAUSING LONG BREAKS IN PRECIPITATION WHILE OTHERS ABSORB HEAT AND LEAD TO A CONVECTION PHENOMENON THAT INCREASES RAINFALL IN SOME PLACES
Tamil-0018-8685	SUCH EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE NEED FOR INDIA TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT ON RISING INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS AND BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS AND BIOMASS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF THE MONSOON
Tamil-0018-8686	AN EQUALLY KEY AREA OF CONCERN IS FRESHWATER AVAILABILITY FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHICH NITI AAYOG SAYS ACCOUNT FOR FOUR PERCENT OF AVAILABLE SUPPLIES BESIDES TWELVE PERCENT USED BY INDUSTRY
Tamil-0018-8687	OKAY SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST RIDICULOUS REASONS WHY PEOPLE NEVER TAKE ACTION ON THEIR IDEAS THEIR VISIONS IS BECAUSE THEYVE FAILED ONCE BEFORE AT SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR
Tamil-0018-8688	HOWEVER THIS TIME AROUND THEYRE DETERMINED NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THEY DID LAST TIME AROUND EVEN IF IT MEANS NOT TRYING IN THE FIRST PLACE
Tamil-0018-8689	WHICH FUNNILY ENOUGH IS THE OPTION MOST PEOPLE WILL DECIDE TO TAKE
Tamil-0018-8690	TONY ROBBINS ONCE SAID THAT HE BELIEVES NOT ACHIEVING OUR GOAL IS PART OF LIFES DESIGN CAUSING US TO REACH DEEP WITHIN AND REALLY PRODUCE THE BEST THAT WE CAN
Tamil-0018-8691	FAILURE IS A PART OF LIFES DESIGN CAUSING YOU TO LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES TO GROW STRONGER FROM THEM IN ORDER TO KEEP GETTING BETTER EVERY TIME YOU TRY AGAIN
Tamil-0018-8692	GIVING UP AFTER ONE FAILURE IS ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS YOU NEED TO STICK IT OUT
Tamil-0020-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE
Tamil-0020-0001	THE CLUMSY CUSTOMER SPILLED SOME EXPENSIVE PERFUME 
Tamil-0020-0002	GRAND AUTO SLID THREE TO FIFTEEN AND ONE EIGHTH ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE 
Tamil-0020-0003	THE COMPANY WHICH RUNS RETAIL AUTOMOTIVE STORES TOLD SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVISER TO TERMINATE DISCUSSIONS TO SELL THE FIRM 
Tamil-0020-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0020-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0020-8727	PRELIMINARY STEPS WERE TAKEN TOWARDS FORGING A NEW CONSTITUTION BUT THE PROCESS SEEMS TO BE AT A STANDSTILL
Tamil-0020-8728	THERE IS NO SENSE OF CLOSURE FOR FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THOUSANDS OVER THE YEARS
Tamil-0020-8729	THE CREATION OF AN OFFICE ON MISSING PERSONS HAS NOT INSPIRED ENOUGH CONFIDENCE
Tamil-0020-8730	THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO SECURE JUSTICE FOR THOSE MASSACRED IN THE CLOSING STAGES OF THE WAR
Tamil-0020-8731	WHAT CONTINUES IS THE FRACTIOUS POLITICS OF LEADERS OF THE NATIONAL PARTIES
Tamil-0020-8732	JOCKEYING FOR POWER HAS OVERSHADOWED THE PROMISE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A PUSH TOWARDS A CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT
Tamil-0020-8733	HALF THE PERIOD SINCE THE END OF THE WAR WAS MARKED BY TRIUMPHALISM AND ALSO WARDING OFF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE FOR AN INQUIRY INTO POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES
Tamil-0020-8734	THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN BROUGHT TO POWER A NEW REGIME A FRESH PROMISE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND THE INFUSION OF A SPIRIT OF POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
Tamil-0020-8735	ANY RECKONING AT THE END OF TEN YEARS WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN MARKED BY A TABULATION OF PEACETIME GAINS AND FAILURES
Tamil-0020-8736	HOWEVER A MONTH AGO EVERYTHING CHANGED
Tamil-0020-8737	THE EASTER SUNDAY BOMBINGS HAVE TAKEN THE COUNTRY BACK TO THE TIME WHEN TERRORISM WAS THE DOMINANT THEME
Tamil-0020-8738	THIS TIME THERE IS NO REAL UNDERLYING CAUSE TO ADDRESS NO GROUP OR ORGANISATION TO TALK TO AND NO TANGIBLE POLITICAL GRIEVANCES TO REDRESS
Tamil-0020-8739	THE SERIAL BLASTS EXECUTED BY FANATICAL ELEMENTS APPARENTLY INSPIRED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE MAY BE A FLASHPOINT FOR A FRESH ROUND OF INTERETHNIC AND INTERRELIGIOUS TENSION
Tamil-0020-8740	ALREADY THERE WAS SOME INDICATION LAST WEEK WHEN SINHALA MOBS ATTACKED PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM VILLAGES IN WAVES DESTROYING PROPERTY AND THREATENING THE PEOPLE
Tamil-0020-8741	ANTITERRORISM LAWS AND EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARE BACK IN FULL MEASURE
Tamil-0020-8742	THE BIGGEST ADVERSE FALLOUT IS THAT A NEW DIMENSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO INTERETHNIC SUSPICIONS THAT MAY DEEPEN DISTRUST AMONG COMMUNITIES
Tamil-0020-8743	AS PROSPECTS OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PAST CRIMES AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM RECEDE SOME SECTIONS INCLUDING THE INCUMBENT REGIME MAY BELIEVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MAY BE ENOUGH TO PROPEL THE COUNTRY FORWARD
Tamil-0020-8744	BUT WHEN TENSIONS PERSIST AMONG COMMUNITIES NOTHING CAN MAKE UP FOR THE ABSENCE OF RECONCILIATION AND TRUST AMONG ALL SECTIONS
Tamil-0020-8745	NEVER HAS SRI LANKA NEEDED A SHARED SENSE OF NATIONHOOD AMONG ALL ITS PEOPLES MORE THAN IT DOES NOW
Tamil-0020-8746	THE ESTIMATES FOR FOREIGN TRADE SHOWING A SHARP SLOWDOWN IN MERCHANDISE EXPORT GROWTH IN APRIL TO POINT SIX FOUR PERCENT FROM A YEAR EARLIER OUGHT TO ADD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY
Tamil-0020-8747	IF ONE WERE TO STRIP AWAY THE THIRTY ONE PERCENT SURGE IN SHIPMENTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS TO OVERSEAS MARKETS INDIAS EXPORT OF GOODS ACTUALLY CONTRACTED BY OVER THREE PERCENT IN DOLLAR TERMS LAST MONTH
Tamil-0020-8748	IN CONTRAST OVERALL MERCHANDISE EXPORTS HAD EXPANDED ELEVEN PERCENT YEARONYEAR IN MARCH WITH THE GROWTH IN SHIPMENTS EXCLUDING PETROLEUM PRODUCTS EXCEEDING THAT PACE BY ABOUT FIFTY BASIS POINTS
Tamil-0020-8749	THE SLUMP IN EXPORTS WAS FAIRLY WIDESPREAD WITH SIXTEEN OF THE THIRTY MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS LISTED BY THE COMMERCE MINISTRY REFLECTING CONTRACTIONS COMPARED WITH THE TEN CATEGORIES THAT HAD SHRUNK IN MARCH
Tamil-0020-8750	WORRYINGLY SHIPMENTS OF ENGINEERING GOODS DECLINED BY OVER SEVEN PERCENT AFTER HAVING EXPANDED BY SIXTEEN PERCENT IN MARCH WHILE THE TRADITIONALLY STRONG EXPORT SECTORS  GEM AND JEWELLERY LEATHER AND LEATHER PRODUCTS TEXTILES AND GARMENTS AND DRUGS AND PHARMACEUTICALS  ALL WEAKENED
Tamil-0020-8751	THESE ARE ALL KEY PROVIDERS OF JOBS AND ANY PROTRACTED PAIN ACROSS THESE INDUSTRIES WILL IMPACT JOBS WAGES AND CONSUMPTION DEMAND IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET
Tamil-0020-8752	COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TO YOU THINKING THAT ITS TOO LATE TO BE ABLE TO START WORKING ON YOUR DREAMS SOME PEOPLE THINK ITS TOO EARLY
Tamil-0020-8753	DO THEY DO THIS OUT OF FEAR MAYBE
Tamil-0020-8754	ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST THINK THAT THEYRE NOT READY TO SOMETHING AND THAT ITS JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THEM TO START 
Tamil-0020-8755	ITS MOSTLY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NOT THEIR ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO DO SO
Tamil-0020-8756	THERES NEVER A PERFECT TIME TO DO SOMETHING 
Tamil-0020-8757	YOU JUST NEED TO WORK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE CURRENT SITUATION
Tamil-0020-8758	GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF THIS LIST ON REASONS WHY PEOPLE NEVER TAKE ACTION NOW ANOTHER RIDICULOUS REASON IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE NORMAL THING TO DO
Tamil-0020-8759	EVERYTHING THEY DO IS CONSIDERED AS A NORMAL THING TO DO AND THEREFORE THY CAN NEVER TAKE ACTION ON THEIR DREAMS BECAUSE DREAMS ARE NOT NORMAL DREAMS SHOULD NOT BE NORMAL
Tamil-0020-8760	THEYRE OUR HIGHEST AMBITIONS

Tamil-0024-8862	DEADLINE CLEARLY ACCOMMODATED PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODIS LAST RALLIES IN THE STATE SLATED FOR THURSDAY EVENING
Tamil-0024-8863	IF IN THE ECS ASSESSMENT CAMPAIGNING COULD HAVE LED TO VIOLENCE WHY DID IT NOT ORDER ITS CURTAILMENT ON WEDNESDAY OR EARLY IN THE DAY ON THURSDAY SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LOK SABHA POLL SCHEDULE THE ECS CREDIBILITY HAS COME UNDER A CLOUD
Tamil-0024-8864	THE MANIFESTLY PARTISAN DECISION ON THE CAMPAIGNING DEADLINE IN WEST BENGAL HAS FURTHER ERODED TRUST IN THE INSTITUTION
Tamil-0024-8865	TRINAMOOL CONGRESS LEADER AND WEST BENGAL CHIEF MINISTER MAMATA BANERJEE WHO HAS BEEN PUTTING UP A FEROCIOUS FIGHT AGAINST HINDUTVA POLITICS IN THE STATE HAS EXPECTEDLY FOUND SUPPORT FROM OPPOSITION PARTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
Tamil-0024-8866	MOST PARTIES HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIABLY CRITICAL OF THE ECS CONDUCT THROUGH THIS ELECTION AND IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE LATEST PROVOCATION HAS REVIVED THEIR COMPLAINTS
Tamil-0024-8867	THE CONGRESS POINTED OUT THAT THE EC HAD DISMISSED ELEVEN COMPLAINTS IT HAD FILED REGARDING MRMODIS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE MCC
Tamil-0024-8868	THE SAMAJWADI PARTYS AKHILESH YADAV SAID THE DECISION WENT AGAINST ALL NORMS OF DEMOCRATIC FAIR PLAY WHILE DMK PRESIDENT MKSTALIN SAID THERE WAS A BJP PATTERN IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VIDYASAGAR STATUE CONNECTING IT TO THE VANDALISATION OF PERIYAR STATUES IN TAMIL NADU LAST YEAR
Tamil-0024-8869	BSP CHIEF MAYAWATI SAID MRMODI AND HIS STOOGES WERE TARGETING MSBANERJEE IN A DANGEROUS AND UNJUST TREND
Tamil-0024-8870	THE BJPS ASSESSMENT OF WEST BENGALS IMPORTANCE FOR ITS CHANCES OF RETURNING TO POWER IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT ITS STRATEGY IS THREATENING THE PEACE IN THE STATE
Tamil-0024-8871	THE ECS ACTION HAS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE ALLOWING MSBANERJEE TO PLAY THE ANGRY VICTIM IN WHAT IS TURNING OUT TO BE THE POWDER KEG OF INDIA
Tamil-0024-8872	THE CASE OF A BJP YUVA MORCHA FUNCTIONARY BEING ARRESTED IN WEST BENGAL FOR SHARING A MORPHED IMAGE OF CHIEF MINISTER MAMATA BANERJEE DEMONSTRATES HOW WRONG AND NEEDLESSLY OPPRESSIVE LEGAL PROCESSES CAN TURN OUT TO BE
Tamil-0024-8873	THE POLICE IN HOWRAH REGISTERED A CASE AND ARRESTED PRIYANKA SHARMA UNDER IRRELEVANT AND NONEXISTENT PROVISIONS A MAGISTRATE SHOWED LITTLE APPLICATION OF MIND WHILE REMANDING HER TO JUDICIAL CUSTODY AND EVEN THE SUPREME COURT WHILE ORDERING HER IMMEDIATE RELEASE DID NOT RECOGNISE SUFFICIENTLY THE PERVERSE MANNER IN WHICH THE LAW WAS BEING USED
Tamil-0024-8874	IT IS A MATTER OF SOME CONSOLATION THAT THE APEX COURT OBSERVED A DAY LATER THAT THE ARREST WAS ARBITRARY AND PULLED UP THE WEST BENGAL GOVERNMENT FOR DELAYING MSSHARMAS RELEASE FOR TECHNICAL REASONS
Tamil-0024-8875	THE POLICE APPARENTLY REALISING THAT THERE WAS NO OFFENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE HAS FILED A CLOSURE REPORT TERMING THE COMPLAINT A MISTAKE OF FACT
Tamil-0024-8876	IT IS A REFLECTION OF THE LEVEL OF ACRIMONY BETWEEN THE RULING TRINAMOOL CONGRESS AND THE BJP IN THE MIDST OF A VIOLENCEMARRED MULTIPHASE ELECTION THAT THE POLICE ENTERTAINED A COMPLAINT FROM A TRINAMOOL CONGRESS ACTIVIST AND BOOKED MSSHARMA FOR CRIMINAL DEFAMATION AND OFFENCES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT
Tamil-0024-8877	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME CONSIDERED THE MORPHED IMAGE  IN WHICH MSBANERJEES FACE WAS APPENDED TO AN ACTORS PHOTOGRAPH AT A MUSEUM EVENT IN NEW YORK  DEFAMATORY
Tamil-0024-8878	BUT IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE POLICE COULD ARREST SOMEONE FOR DEFAMATION BASED ON A THIRD PARTYS COMPLAINT
Tamil-0024-8879	A CYBERCRIME POLICE STATION HANDLED THE CASE APPARENTLY BECAUSE IT INVOLVED SECTION SIXTY SIXA OF THE IT ACT A PROVISION DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SECTION SIXTY SEVENA WHICH CAN BE USED ONLY WHEN SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL IS TRANSMITTED IN ELECTRONIC FORM
Tamil-0024-8880	THUS WHAT WAS AT BEST A CASE OF DEFAMATION A NONCOGNISABLE AND BAILABLE OFFENCE WAS PROJECTED AS A CYBERCRIME WITH THE SOLE AIM OF GETTING THE ACCUSED REMANDED
Tamil-0024-8881	WHILE MAGISTRATES ARE OFTEN KNOWN TO ACT MECHANICALLY  ALTHOUGH THAT IS NO EXCUSE FOR REMANDING THE ACCUSED IN THIS CASE  IT IS DISCONCERTING THAT A BENCH OF THE SUPREME COURT VENTURED TO ADVISE HER TO APOLOGISE FOR SHARING THE IMAGE ON FACEBOOK
Tamil-0024-8882	THE COURT INCLUDED A GRATUITOUS SENTENCE IN ITS ORDER THAT THE DETENU SHALL HOWEVER AT THE TIME OF RELEASE TENDER AN APOLOGY IN WRITING
Tamil-0024-8883	THE INCLUSION OF AN APOLOGY REQUIREMENT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE COURT WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT COOLING FRAYED TEMPERS THAN ABOUT THE BLATANT MISUSE OF THE LAW
Tamil-0024-8884	ANOTHER DISCONCERTING ASPECT IS THAT THE POLICE CONTINUE TO INVOKE SECTION SIXTY SIXA
Tamil-0024-8885	IN JANUARY THE APEX COURT SOUGHT THE CENTRES RESPONSE ON A PETITION THAT CLAIMED THAT POLICE OFFICIALS WERE UNAWARE THAT THE SECTION IS NO MORE ON THE STATUTE BOOK
Tamil-0024-8886	AS THE MAIN ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION THROWN UP BY THIS CASE IS GOING TO BE HEARD IN DETAIL LATER IT IS HOPED THE ABERRANT DEVELOPMENTS SO FAR WILL GIVE WAY TO A REASONED VERDICT
Tamil-0024-8887	I GET DISTRACTED SO MUCH ITS UNREAL 
Tamil-0024-8888	I TRY TO REDUCE DISTRACTIONS BY BLOCKING THE WORLD OUT WITH HEADPHONES AND SITTING IN A GOOD WORKING ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY STILL MANAGE TO PREVAIL ON OCCASION
Tamil-0024-8889	WHAT DISTRACTS YOU MOST
Tamil-0024-8890	HOW CAN YOU STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING WHILST YOURE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE WITH YOUR TIME
Tamil-0024-8891	DISTRACTIONS REALLY DO TAKE AWAY CHUNKS OF YOUR TIME PROBABLY FAR MORE THAN YOU REALLY REALIZE WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW ON THE TIME YOU HAVE AND THEN SEE HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT TIME 
Tamil-0024-8892	THIS VIDEO DISSECTS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE AS HUMAN BEINGS AND REMOVES ALL THE TIME WE USE UP GROOMING OURSELVES SLEEPING WORKING  LOOK AT WHAT YOURE LEFT WITH
Tamil-0024-8893	DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE SURE DISTRACTIONS DONT GET THE BETTER OF YOU

Tamil-0025-8897	IN THE PAST THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN MANY HEADS OF GOVERNMENT TOPPLED
Tamil-0025-8898	THAT SAID SATURDAYS ELECTION MAY NOT PROVE AN EASY RIDE FOR THE FORMER MARKETING EXECUTIVE
Tamil-0025-8899	THE POLLS MAY NOT SIGNAL AN END TO THE POLITICAL INSTABILITY THAT HAS DOGGED AUSTRALIAN POLITICS OF LATE
Tamil-0025-8900	FROM COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE TO SHAPING ENERGY POLICY MRMORRISONS LIBERAL PARTY IS A DIVIDED HOUSE BETWEEN MODERATES AND CONSERVATIVES
Tamil-0025-8901	THESE DIFFERENCES WERE MANIFEST IN THE OUSTING OF MALCOLM TURNBULL LAST YEAR AND CONTINUE TO ELUDE A RESOLUTION

Tamil-0025-8908	A FOURTY FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS ON TWO THOUSAND FIVE LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY IS PART OF ITS MANIFESTO AIMED AT APPEALING TO AUSTRALIAS GROWING NUMBER OF GREEN VOTERS
Tamil-0025-8909	CONVERSELY THE PROBUSINESS CREDENTIALS OF MRMORRISONS LIBERALNATIONAL COALITION ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN STEADILY ERODED AS THE GOVERNMENT HAS RENEGED ON ITS PROMISE OF CORPORATE TAX CUTS
Tamil-0025-8910	THE PACKAGE OF MEASURES UNVEILED IN THE PREELECTION BUDGET IN APRIL MAY ONLY HAVE A MODERATE IMPACT
Tamil-0025-8911	AS WITH SEVERAL INDUSTRIALISED DEMOCRACIES VOTER DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE PRINCIPAL PARTIES IS YIELDING A FRAGMENTED POLITY AND SMALLER PARTIES AND INDEPENDENTS COULD POTENTIALLY TILT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SENATE WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION
Tamil-0025-8912	WITH CONSISTENT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MODEST LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AUSTRALIA HAS HAD A REMARKABLE TRACK RECORD IN RECENT DECADES
Tamil-0025-8913	THIS SCENARIO IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE INCESSANT POLITICAL SWINGS THAT IMPEDE THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Tamil-0025-8914	WHAT IS WITHOUT DOUBT IS THAT THE TURNOUT WILL BE HIGH AT THE POLLS AS VOTING IS COMPULSORY FOR REGISTERED VOTERS
Tamil-0025-8915	A WELTER OF DATA COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY POINT TO ONE WORRYING CONCLUSION ECONOMIC MOMENTUM ACROSS SECTORS IS SLOWING IN THE WIDENING ABSENCE OF THAT KEY INGREDIENT DEMAND
Tamil-0025-8916	DOMESTIC SALES OF CARS COMMERCIAL VEHICLES AND TWO WHEELERS ALL CONTRACTED IN APRIL FROM A YEAR EARLIER THE SOCIETY OF INDIAN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS SIAM HAS REPORTED
Tamil-0025-8917	THE DECLINE OF ALMOST SIXTEEN PERCENT IN TOTAL AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY SALES IS AN INDICATION THAT CONSUMPTION DEMAND ACROSS MARKETS  URBAN AND RURAL INSTITUTIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL  IS PETERING OUT

Tamil-0029-9032	IN THEORY EXCESS ENRICHED URANIUM AND HEAVY WATER ALLOW IRAN TO EXPAND ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAMME BUT IT HASNT ANNOUNCED ANY SUCH PLAN

Tamil-0031-9105	NATURE PROVIDES ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BUT THESE ARE OFTEN NOT INCLUDED IN PRODUCTIVITY ESTIMATES THEY ARE VITAL FOR FOOD PRODUCTION FOR CLEAN AIR AND WATER PROVISION OF FUEL FOR MILLIONS ABSORPTION OF CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND CLIMATE MODERATION
Tamil-0031-9106	THE RESULT OF SUCH SKEWED POLICIES AS THE IPBES ESTIMATES IS THAT THE GLOBAL RATE OF SPECIES EXTINCTION IS AT LEAST TENS TO HUNDREDS OF TIMES HIGHER TODAY THAN THE AVERAGE RATE OVER THE PAST TEN MILLION YEARS AND IT IS ACCELERATING ALARMINGLY
Tamil-0031-9107	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMISTS HAVE FOR YEARS POINTED TO THE EXTREME HARM THAT HUMANITY AS A WHOLE IS COURTING BY MODIFYING TERRESTRIAL MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS TO SUIT IMMEDIATE NEEDS SUCH AS RAISING AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD OUTPUT AND EXTRACTING MATERIALS THAT AID EVERINCREASING CONSUMPTION
Tamil-0031-9108	EXPANDING AGRICULTURE BY CUTTING DOWN FORESTS HAS RAISED FOOD VOLUMES AND MINING FEEDS MANY INDUSTRIES BUT THESE HAVE SEVERELY AFFECTED OTHER FUNCTIONS SUCH AS WATER AVAILABILITY POLLINATION MAINTENANCE OF WILD VARIANTS OF DOMESTICATED PLANTS AND CLIMATE REGULATION
Tamil-0031-9109	LOSSES FROM POLLUTION ARE USUALLY NOT FACTORED INTO CLAIMS OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS MADE BY COUNTRIES BUT AS THE IPBES ASSESSMENT POINTS OUT MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION HAS INCREASED TENFOLD SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY AFFECTING AT LEAST TWO SIXTY SEVEN SPECIES INCLUDING EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF MARINE TURTLES FOURTY FOUR PERCENT OF SEABIRDS AND FOURTY THREE PERCENT OF MARINE MAMMALS
Tamil-0031-9110	AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF SIX THOUNSAND TWO HUNDRED DOMESTICATED BREEDS OF MAMMALS USED FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE HAD GONE EXTINCT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND MAY DISAPPEAR PERMANENTLY
Tamil-0031-9111	VIEWED AGAINST A SHRINKING BASE OF WILD VARIETIES OF FARMED PLANTS AND ANIMALS ALL COUNTRIES HAVE CAUSE FOR ALARM
Tamil-0031-9112	THEY ARE RAPIDLY EMPTYING THEIR GENETIC RESOURCE KIT
Tamil-0031-9113	REVERSING COURSE IS A DIRE NECESSITY TO STAVE OFF DISASTER
Tamil-0031-9114	THIS CAN BE DONE BY INCORPORATING BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS INTO ALL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY RECOGNISING THAT IRREPARABLY BREAKING THE WEB OF LIFE WILL IMPOVERISH AND ENDANGER PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
Tamil-0031-9115	CYCLONE FANI HAS LEFT A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION ACROSS A LARGE PART OF COASTAL ODISHA BUT ITS MANAGEMENT HAS EMERGED AS A GLOBAL EXAMPLE OF HOW TIMELY WEATHER ALERTS PREPAREDNESS AND INFORMED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE LOSS OF LIFE
Tamil-0031-9116	THE TOLL FROM THE EXTREMELY SEVERE CYCLONIC STORM ON MAY THREE STOOD AT LAST COUNT AT THIRTY FOUR DEATHS
Tamil-0031-9117	IN TERMS OF MATERIAL LOSSES SEVERAL DISTRICTS WERE BATTERED HOUSES FLATTENED AND ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE DESTROYED BUT THE RELATIVELY LOW MORTALITY SHOWS A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION FROM THE LOSS OF OVER TEN THOUSAND LIVES IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHEN SUPER CYCLONE ZERO FIVE B STRUCK
Tamil-0031-9118	ODISHA THEN WORKED TO UPGRADE ITS PREPAREDNESS WHICH WAS TESTED WHEN VERY SEVERE CYCLONIC STORM PHAILIN STRUCK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN
Tamil-0031-9119	IT WAS ABLE TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBER OF DEATHS TO FOURTY FOUR THEN IN SPITE OF A WIDE ARC OF DESTRUCTION THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WERE HIT AND HALF A MILLION HOUSES DESTROYED
Tamil-0031-9120	THE ODISHA GOVERNMENT AND THE CENTRE NOW HAVE THE TASK OF REBUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE
Tamil-0031-9121	THEY SHOULD USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE TECHNOLOGY ACHIEVE COST EFFICIENCIES AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO EXTREME WEATHER ALL OF WHICH CAN MINIMISE FUTURE LOSSES
Tamil-0031-9122	A GENTLEMAN WAS WALKING THROUGH AN ELEPHANT CAMP AND HE SPOTTED THAT THE ELEPHANTS WERENT BEING KEPT IN CAGES OR HELD BY THE USE OF CHAINS
Tamil-0031-9123	ALL THAT WAS HOLDING THEM BACK FROM ESCAPING THE CAMP WAS A SMALL PIECE OF ROPE TIED TO ONE OF THEIR LEGS
Tamil-0031-9124	AS THE MAN GAZED UPON THE ELEPHANTS HE WAS COMPLETELY CONFUSED AS TO WHY THE ELEPHANTS DIDNT JUST USE THEIR STRENGTH TO BREAK THE ROPE AND ESCAPE THE CAMP THEY COULD EASILY HAVE DONE SO BUT INSTEAD THEY DIDNT TRY TO AT ALL
Tamil-0031-9125	CURIOUS AND WANTING TO KNOW THE ANSWER HE ASKED A TRAINER NEARBY WHY THE ELEPHANTS WERE JUST STANDING THERE AND NEVER TRIED TO ESCAPE
Tamil-0031-9126	THE TRAINER REPLIED WHEN THEY ARE VERY YOUNG AND MUCH SMALLER WE USE THE SAME SIZE ROPE TO TIE THEM AND AT THAT AGE ITS ENOUGH TO OLD THEM 
Tamil-0031-9127	AS THEY GROW UP THEY ARE CONDITIONED TO BELIEVE THEY CANNOT BREAK AWAY 
Tamil-0031-9128	THEY BELIEVE THE ROPE CAN STILL HOLD THEM SO THEY NEVER TRY TO BREAK FREE
Tamil-0031-9129	THE ONLY REASON THAT THE ELEPHANTS WERENT BREAKING FREE AND ESCAPING FROM THE CAMP WAS THAT OVER TIME THEY ADOPTED THE BELIEF THAT IT JUST WASNT POSSIBLE
Tamil-0031-9130	MORAL OF THE STORY NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE WORLD TRIES TO HOLD YOU BACK ALWAYS CONTINUE WITH THE BELIEF THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE IS POSSIBLE 
Tamil-0031-9131	BELIEVING YOU CAN BECOME SUCCESSFUL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN ACTUALLY ACHIEVING IT
Tamil-0032-0000	TRADITION REQUIRES PARENTAL APPROVAL FOR UNDERAGE MARRIAGE

Tamil-0032-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0032-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0032-9132	GIVEN THE VULNERABILITY OF ODISHA AND ANDHRA PRADESH TO CYCLONES THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF WHICH MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A CHANGING CLIMATE THE CENTRE SHOULD PRESS FOR GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUNDING UNDER THE UN FRAMEWORK TO HELP IN THE REBUILDING
Tamil-0032-9133	BOTH STATES HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE WORLD BANK IN CYCLONE RISK MITIGATION EFFORTS SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN
Tamil-0032-9134	THE PRIORITY IN ODISHA IS TO RESTORE ELECTRICITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WHICH WILL REQUIRE MASSIVE MANPOWER
Tamil-0032-9135	THIS SHOULD BE TREATED AS A NATIONAL MISSION
Tamil-0032-9136	PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS ARE PARAMOUNT TO AVOID DISEASE OUTBREAKS
Tamil-0032-9137	THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO RESTORE SOME PHYSICAL MOVEMENT BY OPENING UP HIGHWAYS AND DISTRICT ROADS THE CENTRE HAS RELIEVED TENSION AMONG STUDENTS BY POSTPONING THE NATIONAL ELIGIBILITYCUMENTRANCE TEST IN ODISHA
Tamil-0032-9138	OVERALL THERE IS A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT IN THE MIDST OF A NATIONAL ELECTION THE TOLL WAS EFFECTIVELY CONTAINED
Tamil-0032-9139	LOOKING AHEAD INDIA MUST PREPARE FOR MANY MORE INTENSE AND FREQUENT CYCLONES ALONG THE COASTAL STATES
Tamil-0032-9140	PREPAREDNESS HAS TO FOCUS ON BUILDING RESILIENCE AND STRENGTHENING ADAPTATION
Tamil-0032-9141	THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH BETTERDESIGNED HOUSES AND CYCLONE SHELTERS GOOD EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS PERIODIC DRILLS AND FINANCIAL RISK REDUCTION THROUGH INSURANCE
Tamil-0032-9142	EARLY WEATHER WARNINGS HOLD THE KEY TO BETTER MANAGEMENT AND DURING THE FANI EPISODE THE INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE
Tamil-0032-9143	ITS COMMENDABLE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN RECOGNISED BY THE UN AS WELL
Tamil-0032-9144	ODISHAS EXPERIENCE WHICH COINCIDES WITH SIMILAR DEVASTATION ALONG EAST AFRICA THIS YEAR WILL BE KEENLY FOLLOWED AT THE UN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION CONFERENCE CONVENING ON MAY THIRTEEN IN GENEVA
Tamil-0032-9145	VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER JUAN GUAID HAS BEEN TRYING TO OUST PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO FOR MONTHS
Tamil-0032-9146	LAST WEEK IN HIS MOST DAUNTING EFFORT YET HE CALLED FOR A MILITARY UPRISING
Tamil-0032-9147	HOURS LATER THE US WHICH HAS RECOGNISED HIM AS VENEZUELAS PRESIDENT SUPPORTED HIS BID
Tamil-0032-9148	A FEW SOLDIERS BROKE RANKS WITH THE MILITARY AND JOINED HIM ALONG WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS WHO BATTLED FOR TWO DAYS WITH POLICE AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS
Tamil-0032-9149	STILL MRGUAID FAILED TO TOPPLE THE MADURO REGIME
Tamil-0032-9150	THIS WAS THE THIRD MAJOR ATTEMPT BY MRGUAID TO SEIZE THE GOVERNMENT
Tamil-0032-9151	IN JANUARY HE DECLARED HIMSELF PRESIDENT SAYING MRMADUROS PRESIDENCY WAS NOT LEGITIMATE AS HE HAD RIGGED LAST YEARS ELECTION
Tamil-0032-9152	SINCE THEN THE USHAS IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON TOP VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE STATERUN OIL COMPANY PDVSA ON THE CALCULATION THAT THESE WOULD MAKE THE ALREADY BATTERED VENEZUELAN ECONOMY WORSE RENDERING MRMADURO EVEN MORE UNPOPULAR
Tamil-0032-9153	IN FEBRUARY MRGUAID LAUNCHED ANOTHER BID WHEN HE WENT TO THE COLOMBIA BORDER TO ACCEPT USAID WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAD REJECTED
Tamil-0032-9154	HE CALLED FOR MASS PROTESTS BUT MRMADURO SURVIVED
Tamil-0032-9155	LAST WEEKS FAILED ATTEMPT WAS MRGUAIDS BIGGEST SETBACK SO FAR
Tamil-0032-9156	IT IS EVIDENT THAT VENEZUELA IS GOING THROUGH SERIOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES
Tamil-0032-9157	IN A SMALL ITALIAN TOWN HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OWED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO A LOANSHARK 
Tamil-0032-9158	THE LOANSHARK WAS A VERY OLD UNATTRACTIVE LOOKING GUY THAT JUST SO HAPPENED TO FANCY THE BUSINESS OWNERS DAUGHTER
Tamil-0032-9159	HE DECIDED TO OFFER THE BUSINESSMAN A DEAL THAT WOULD COMPLETELY WIPE OUT THE DEBT HE OWED HIM 
Tamil-0032-9160	HOWEVER THE CATCH WAS THAT WE WOULD ONLY WIPE OUT THE DEBT IF HE COULD MARRY THE BUSINESSMANS DAUGHTER
Tamil-0032-9161	NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS PROPOSAL WAS MET WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST
Tamil-0032-9162	THE LOANSHARK SAID THAT HE WOULD PLACE TWO PEBBLES INTO A BAG ONE WHITE AND ONE BLACK
Tamil-0032-9163	THE DAUGHTER WOULD THEN HAVE TO REACH INTO THE BAG AND PICK OUT A PEBBLE 
Tamil-0032-9164	IF IT WAS BLACK THE DEBT WOULD BE WIPED BUT THE LOANSHARK WOULD THEN MARRY HER 
Tamil-0032-9165	IF IT WAS WHITE THE DEBT WOULD ALSO BE WIPED BUT THE DAUGHTER WOULDNT HAVE TO MARRY THE LOANSHARK
Tamil-0032-9166	STANDING ON A PEBBLESTREWN PATH IN THE BUSINESSMANS GARDEN THE LOANSHARK BENT OVER AND PICKED UP TWO PEBBLES
Tamil-0032-9167	WHILST HE WAS PICKING THEM UP THE DAUGHTER NOTICED THAT HED PICKED UP TWO BLACK PEBBLES AND PLACED THEM BOTH INTO THE BAG
Tamil-0032-9168	HE THEN ASKED THE DAUGHTER TO REACH INTO THE BAG AND PICK ONE
Tamil-0032-9169	THE DAUGHTER NATURALLY HAD THREE CHOICES AS TO WHAT SHE COULD HAVE DONE
Tamil-0032-9170	REFUSE TO PICK A PEBBLE FROM THE BAG
Tamil-0032-9171	TAKE BOTH PEBBLES OUT OF THE BAG AND EXPOSE THE LOANSHARK FOR CHEATING
Tamil-0032-9172	PICK A PEBBLE FROM THE BAG FULLY WELL KNOWING IT WAS BLACK AND SACRIFICE HERSELF FOR HER FATHERS FREEDOM
Tamil-0032-9173	SHE DREW OUT A PEBBLE FROM THE BAG AND BEFORE LOOKING AT IT ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED IT INTO THE MIDST OF THE OTHER PEBBLES SHE SAID TO THE LOANSHARK
Tamil-0032-9174	OH HOW CLUMSY OF ME NEVER MIND IF YOU LOOK INTO THE BAG FOR THE ONE THAT IS LEFT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH PEBBLE I PICKED
Tamil-0032-9175	THE PEBBLE LEFT IN THE BAG IS OBVIOUSLY BLACK AND SEEING AS THE LOANSHARK DIDNT WANT TO BE EXPOSED HE HAD TO PLAY ALONG AS IF THE PEBBLE THE DAUGHTER DROPPED WAS WHITE AND CLEAR HER FATHERS DEBT
Tamil-0032-9176	MORAL OF THE STORY ITS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME A TOUGH SITUATION THROUGHOUT OF THE BOX THINKING AND NOT GIVE IN TO THE ONLY OPTIONS YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO PICK FROM

Tamil-0036-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0036-9279	NATIONS MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS EVENTUALITY THE IACG SAYS AND ACT TO FIGHT IT
Tamil-0036-9280	FOR HIGH AND MIDINCOME NATIONS THE PRICE OF PREVENTION AT DOLLAR TWO PER HEAD A YEAR IS EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE
Tamil-0036-9281	FOR POORER COUNTRIES THE PRICE IS HIGHER BUT STILL MODEST COMPARED TO THE COSTS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC APOCALYPSE
Tamil-0036-9282	INDIA FIRST PUBLISHED ALMOST NINE YEARS AGO THE BROAD CONTOURS OF A PLAN TO FIGHT ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
Tamil-0036-9283	THE DIFFICULTY HAS BEEN IN IMPLEMENTING IT GIVEN THE TWIN CHALLENGES OF ANTIBIOTIC OVERUSE AND UNDERUSE
Tamil-0036-9284	ON THE ONE HAND MANY INDIANS STILL DIE OF DISEASES LIKE SEPSIS AND PNEUMONIA BECAUSE THEY DONT GET THE RIGHT DRUG AT THE RIGHT TIME
Tamil-0036-9285	ON THE OTHER HAND A POORLY REGULATED PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY MEANS THAT ANTIBIOTICS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD THEM
Tamil-0036-9286	THE IACG REPORT ACKNOWLEDGES THESE OBSTACLES AND CALLS FOR EFFORTS TO OVERCOME THEM
Tamil-0036-9287	SOME STEPS CAN BE INITIATED RIGHT AWAY IT SAYS SUCH AS PHASING OUT CRITICAL HUMANUSE ANTIBIOTICS IN THE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY SECTOR SUCH AS QUINOLONES
Tamil-0036-9288	BUT THESE STEPS CANNOT BE DRIVEN BY REGULATION ALONE
Tamil-0036-9289	A MULTISTAKEHOLDER APPROACH INVOLVING PRIVATE INDUSTRY PHILANTHROPIC GROUPS AND CITIZEN ACTIVISTS IS NEEDED
Tamil-0036-9290	PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES MUST TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO DISTRIBUTE DRUGS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER
Tamil-0036-9291	PHILANTHROPIC CHARITIES MUST FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW ANTIBIOTICS WHILE CITIZEN ACTIVISTS MUST DRIVE AWARENESS
Tamil-0036-9292	THESE STAKEHOLDERS MUST APPRECIATE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO POSTPONE RESISTANCE IS THROUGH IMPROVED HYGIENE AND VACCINATIONS
Tamil-0036-9293	IT IS A FORMIDABLE TASK AS INDIA STILL STRUGGLES WITH LOW IMMUNISATION RATES AND DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION
Tamil-0036-9294	BUT IT MUST CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF A FAILURE
Tamil-0036-9295	WHILE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTNINE FINANCIAL CRISIS CAUSED GLOBAL HARDSHIPS ITS EFFECTS BEGAN TO WEAR OFF BY TWENTY ELEVEN
Tamil-0036-9296	ONCE CRUCIAL ANTIBIOTICS ARE LOST TO HUMANKIND THEY MAY BE LOST FOR DECADES
Tamil-0036-9297	TWO YEARS AFTER THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE FORUM WAS UNVEILED WITH FANFARE CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPINGS ADDRESS TO THE SECOND BRI FORUM WAS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT BEIJING IS COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PUSHBACK HIS AMBITIOUS PROJECT HAS RECEIVED
Tamil-0036-9298	MRXIS SPEECH TO THIRTY SEVEN HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AND THE IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR HAD MANY SIGNIFICANT TAKEAWAYS INCLUDING A STATED COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF BRI PROJECTS AND TO GREATER DEBT SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FINANCING MODEL OF THE BELT AND ROAD UNDER NEW GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Tamil-0036-9299	SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN INDIA THE USAND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY WITH WHICH MANY OF THE BRI PROJECTS WERE NEGOTIATED WITH GOVERNMENTS
Tamil-0036-9300	SRI LANKA THE MALDIVES AND MALAYSIA HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ON SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER FEARS OF A DEBT TRAP AND ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN BRI PROJECTS BECAME ELECTION ISSUES
Tamil-0036-9301	IN APRIL LAST YEAR EUROPEAN UNION AMBASSADORS TO BEIJING ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING THE BRI RAN COUNTER TO THEIR AGENDA FOR LIBERALISING TRADE AND PUSHED THE BALANCE OF POWER IN FAVOUR OF SUBSIDISED CHINESE COMPANIES
Tamil-0036-9302	AFTER CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA CHINAS BIGGEST FORAY IS INTO EUROPE AND THE CRITICISM DID NOT GO UNHEEDED BY BEIJING
Tamil-0036-9303	CHINA AGREED TO RENEGOTIATE TERMS ON PROJECTS REACHED OUT TO REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE ARAB AND AFRICAN FORUMS AND THE EU WHERE PREMIER LI KEQIANG PLEDGED TO RESPECT EU RULES AND STANDARDS AT A SUMMIT OF SEVENTEEN ONE  CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THE BRI
Tamil-0036-9304	THERE ONCE WAS A LITTLE BOY WHO HAD A VERY BAD TEMPER HIS FATHER DECIDED TO HAND HIM A BAG OF NAILS AND SAID THAT EVERY TIME THE BOY LOST HIS TEMPER HE HAD TO HAMMER A NAIL INTO THE FENCE
Tamil-0036-9305	ON THE FIRST DAY THE BOY HAMMERED 37 NAILS INTO THAT FENCE
Tamil-0036-9306	THE BOY GRADUALLY BEGAN TO CONTROL HIS TEMPER OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND THE NUMBER OF NAILS HE WAS HAMMERING INTO THE FENCE SLOWLY DECREASED
Tamil-0036-9307	HE DISCOVERED IT WAS EASIER TO CONTROL HIS TEMPER THAN TO HAMMER THOSE NAILS INTO THE FENCE
Tamil-0036-9308	FINALLY THE DAY CAME WHEN THE BOY DIDNT LOSE HIS TEMPER AT ALL 
Tamil-0036-9309	HE TOLD HIS FATHER THE NEWS AND THE FATHER SUGGESTED THAT THE BOY SHOULD NOW PULL OUT A NAIL EVERY DAY HE KEPT HIS TEMPER UNDER CONTROL
Tamil-0036-9310	THE DAYS PASSED AND THE YOUNG BOY WAS FINALLY ABLE TO TELL HIS FATHER THAT ALL THE NAILS WERE GONE 
Tamil-0036-9311	THE FATHER TOOK HIS SON BY THE HAND AND LED HIM TO THE FENCE
Tamil-0036-9312	YOU HAVE DONE WELL MY SON BUT LOOK AT THE HOLES IN THE FENCE THE FENCE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME 
Tamil-0036-9313	WHEN YOU SAY THINGS IN ANGER THEY LEAVE A SCAR JUST LIKE THIS ONE YOU CAN PUT A KNIFE IN A MAN AND DRAW IT OUT 
Tamil-0036-9314	IT WONT MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SAY IM SORRY THE WOUND IS STILL THERE
Tamil-0036-9315	MORAL OF THE STORY CONTROL YOUR ANGER AND DONT SAY THINGS TO PEOPLE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT YOU MAY LATER REGRET SOME THINGS IN LIFE YOU ARE UNABLE TO TAKE BACK

Tamil-0040-9428	AND A LANDSLIDE BECAME A PROBABILITY WITH EVERY PASSING DAY AFTER MRZELENSKY BEAT MRPOROSHENKO BY A HEFTY MARGIN IN THE FIRST ROUND OF POLLING ON MARCH THIRTY ONE 
Tamil-0040-9429	SINCE RUSSIAS SEIZURE OF UKRAINIAN NAVAL VESSELS IN NOVEMBER MRPOROSHENKO HAD PITCHED HIS CAMPAIGN MERELY ON THE NEED TO BOLSTER NATIONAL UNITY AGAINST THE THREAT FROM MOSCOW AND ASSERT UKRAINES UNIQUE NATIONAL IDENTITY
Tamil-0040-9430	BUT THE FINAL BATTLE TURNED BRUTAL AND BITTER EVEN IF THE RIVAL CANDIDATES CAMPAIGNS WERE WOEFULLY SHORT ON SUBSTANCE
Tamil-0040-9431	MRPOROSHENKO AN EXOLIGARCH IN CONFECTIONARIES ATTACKED HIS OPPONENT AS A PUPPET OF ANOTHER OLIGARCH
Tamil-0040-9432	THE REFERENCE WAS TO IGOR KOLOMOISKY WHOSE TV CHANNEL RAN MRZELENSKYS POPULAR SHOW AND HAS BUSINESS INTERESTS SPANNING FINANCE AND MEDIA
Tamil-0040-9433	THE COMMERCIAL BANK HE OWNED WAS NATIONALISED BY THE OUTGOING DISPENSATION AS PART OF AN ECONOMIC CLEANUP AND MRKOLOMOISKY MAY HAVE SENSED AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE ELECTION TO SETTLE SCORES
Tamil-0040-9434	FOR HIS PART MRZELENSKY USED A FINAL PREELECTION DEBATE IN KIEV TO ARGUE THAT HIS CANDIDACY WAS A JUDGMENT ON THE INCUMBENT AND THAT HIS BID WAS THE RESULT OF MRPOROSHENKOS MISTAKES
Tamil-0040-9435	AS PRESIDENT MRZELENSKY ENTERS UNCHARTED TERRITORY
Tamil-0040-9436	THE FIRST CHALLENGE BEFORE HIM IS THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR IN WHICH HE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS AND PARTIES HE HAD RAILED AGAINST DURING THE CAMPAIGN
Tamil-0040-9437	THERE IS ALSO THE CONTINUING CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA IN THE REBELHELD TERRITORIES IN EASTERN UKRAINE WHERE HIS POLITICAL INEXPERIENCE MIGHT BE A SERIOUS HANDICAP
Tamil-0040-9438	FINALLY MRZELENSKY WILL BE EXPECTED TO DELIVER RESULTS IN THE COUNTRYS CRUSADE AGAINST CORRUPTION
Tamil-0040-9439	PROGRESS IN EACH OF THESE AREAS WILL BE CRUCIAL DETERMINANTS IN UKRAINES BID FOR EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP
Tamil-0040-9440	THE TELEVISION STAR WILL SOON DISCOVER THAT WHILE THEATRE MIGHT BE A GOOD LAUNCHPAD FOR THE START OF A POLITICAL CAREER IT IS NO PREPARATORY GROUND FOR THE REAL TASKS OF GOVERNANCE
Tamil-0040-9441	THE OIL MARKET IS IN FERMENT ONCE AGAIN WITH A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY OVER SUPPLIES
Tamil-0040-9442	ON MONDAY THE UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD NOT EXTEND BEYOND MAY ONE THE ONE EIGHTYDAY WAIVER IT HAD GRANTED TO EIGHT COUNTRIES INCLUDING INDIA TO PURCHASE OIL FROM IRAN
Tamil-0040-9443	THIS CAUSED THE PRICE OF BRENT CRUDE OIL TO WITNESS A SUDDEN JUMP TO MORE THAN DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE  FROM LAST WEEKS CLOSE OF DOLLAR SEVENTY ONE AS TRADERS EXPECTED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE WAIVERS TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF OIL IN THE MARKET
Tamil-0040-9444	THE PRICE OF BRENT CRUDE IT IS WORTH NOTING HAS BEEN RISING STEADILY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT SINCE IT HIT A LOW OF ABOUT DOLLAR FIFTY IN DECEMBER AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES OPEC TO RESTRICT THEIR OUTPUT TO BOOST PRICES
Tamil-0040-9445	INDIA IMPORTS MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF ITS CRUDE OIL FROM IRAN SO THE GOVERNMENT FACES THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE OF HAVING TO FIND ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS TO MEET ITS HUGE ENERGY NEEDS
Tamil-0040-9446	EVEN MORE WORRYING IS THE LIKELY NEGATIVE IMPACT HIGHER OIL PRICES WILL HAVE ON INDIAS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT FISCAL DEFICIT AND INFLATION IN THE WIDER ECONOMY
Tamil-0040-9447	THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH NARROWED TO TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT OF GDP IN THE DECEMBER QUARTER THANKS TO LOWER OIL PRICES WILL LIKELY WORSEN GOING FORWARD
Tamil-0040-9448	THE FISCAL DEFICIT WHICH HAS BEEN WIDENING IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTIONS IS ALSO LIKELY TO GET INCREASINGLY OUT OF CONTROL
Tamil-0040-9449	WHILE INFLATION IS RELATIVELY BENIGN AT THE MOMENT ANY FURTHER ACCELERATION IN PRICE GAINS WILL TIE THE HANDS OF THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA
Tamil-0040-9450	IT MAY HOWEVER BE HARD TO SAY FOR SURE THAT THE JUMP IN THE PRICE OF OIL THIS WEEK AND OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS MARKS A SECULAR RISE IN THE PRICE OF THE COMMODITY
Tamil-0040-9451	THE ENTRY OF USSHALE PRODUCERS INTO THE OIL MARKET HAS PUT A LID ON THE PRICE OF OIL AS FREELY COMPETING SHALE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO INCREASE THEIR OUTPUT WHENEVER OIL PRICES RISE SIGNIFICANTLY
Tamil-0040-9452	EVEN THIS WEEK THE OIL MARKET HAS BEEN TORN BETWEEN THE NEWS OF THE END TO THE WAIVERS GRANTED TO OIL IMPORTS FROM IRAN AND COMPETING NEWS OF THE INCREASED SUPPLY OF OIL POURING INTO THE MARKET FROM THE USHIGHER OIL PRICES ALSO MAKE IT LUCRATIVE EACH TIME FOR MEMBERS OF OPEC TO CHEAT ON THEIR COMMITMENTS TO RESTRICT SUPPLY

Tamil-0040-9455	VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY AFFECTS ABOUT 80 OF THE POPULATION SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST AND MOST NATURAL METHOD TO GET VITAMIN D
Tamil-0040-9456	DEFICIENCY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A HOST OF DISEASES INCLUDING HEART DISEASE DEPRESSION OSTEOPOROSIS AND MANY MORE

Tamil-0040-9461	PARTICIPATING IN STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MEDITATION YOGA AND TAI CHI CAN REALLY REDUCE HOW STRESS AFFECTS YOUR BODY

Tamil-0041-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0041-9463	IF INDIA IS TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS IN THE EVERVOLATILE GLOBAL OIL MARKET THE GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO DIVERSIFY ITS SUPPLIER BASE AND ALSO WORK TOWARDS INCREASING DOMESTIC SOURCES OF ENERGY SUPPLIES
Tamil-0041-9464	OPENING UP THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR FOR MORE INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO HELP AVOID OVERDEPENDENCE ON OIL FROM THE GLOBAL MARKET TO MEET THE COUNTRYS EVERINCREASING ENERGY NEEDS
Tamil-0041-9465	VOTING HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THREE HUNDRED AND TWO OF THE FIVE FOURTY THREE LOK SABHA CONSTITUENCIES IN THE FIRST THREE PHASES OF POLLING
Tamil-0041-9466	THE THIRD PHASE OF POLLING ON TUESDAY WAS SPREAD ACROSS FOURTEEN STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES IN ONE FIFTEEN CONSTITUENCIES
Tamil-0041-9467	IN ADDITION POLLING FOR THE EAST TRIPURA SEAT WHICH WAS POSTPONED FROM APRIL EIGHTEEN AFTER THE EC CONCLUDED THAT THE LAW AND ORDER SITUATION THERE WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO HOLDING FREE AND FAIR POLLS TOOK PLACE ON TUESDAY
Tamil-0041-9468	WITH THE THIRD PHASE MORE THAN HALF THE CONSTITUENCIES HAVE VOTED INCLUDING ALL IN THE SOUTHERN STATES AND GUJARAT
Tamil-0041-9469	VOTING TRENDS INDICATE THAT THE TURNOUT IN GENERAL WOULD HOVER AROUND THE TWENTY FOURTEEN LEVELS
Tamil-0041-9470	THE MASSIVE TURNOUT IN KERALA AND HIGHER TURNOUTS IN THE TRIBAL REGIONS OF GUJARAT ARE NOTEWORTHY IN THE THIRD PHASE AND COULD INFLUENCE THE RESULT
Tamil-0041-9471	THROUGH THE SECOND AND THIRD PHASES THE BJP TRIED TO ALTER THE BEATEN PATH OF POLITICS IN KERALA AND TAMIL NADU WHILE DOUBLING DOWN ON ITS HINDUTVA AGENDA IN THE HINDI HEARTLAND AND GUJARAT
Tamil-0041-9472	THE BJPS STRATEGY TO RETAIN POWER AT THE CENTRE NOW CLEARLY INVOLVES LIMITING THE INEVITABLE LOSSES IN ITS STRONGHOLDS PROMOTING FRIENDLY REGIONAL PARTIES WHERE ITS PRESENCE IS LIMITED AND OPENING SOME NEW TERRITORIES FOR ITSELF
Tamil-0041-9473	THE MANIFESTATION OF THIS STRATEGY WAS VISIBLE IN THE ONESIDED ACTIONS OF THE INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT IN TAMIL NADU AND KARNATAKA THAT TARGETED ONLY THOSE FROM THE OPPOSITION PARTIES
Tamil-0041-9474	IN THE SIXTEENTH LOK SABHA THE BJP HAD TWENTY ONE OF THE ONE TWENTY NINE SEATS IN THE FIVE SOUTHERN STATES SEVENTEEN OF THEM FROM KARNATAKA
Tamil-0041-9475	IN KERALA THE BJP APPEARS TO HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INROADS BY MOBILISING PROTESTS AGAINST THE ENTRY OF ALL WOMEN INTO THE SABARIMALA SHRINE
Tamil-0041-9476	DURING HIS TOUR OF THE STATE PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI SAID THAT THE BJP WAS AN INCLUSIVE AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY THUS SOFTPEDALLING THE HYPERNATIONALISM THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE MAINSTAY OF HIS CAMPAIGNING IN GENERAL
Tamil-0041-9477	THIS ATTEMPT TO SOUND REASONABLE TO THE DIVERSE KERALA SOCIETY RUNS PARALLEL TO THE MOST CORROSIVE DEMONSTRATION OF HINDUTVA TILL DATE DURING THIS ELECTION SEASON IN THE CANDIDACY OF PRAGYA SINGH THAKUR WHO IS AN ACCUSED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS
Tamil-0041-9478	MSSINGH THE BJP CANDIDATE FROM BHOPAL HAS OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS MADE SEVERAL INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS
Tamil-0041-9479	OVERALL THE SHRILLNESS OF THE BJP RHETORIC HAS ONLY RISEN AS CAMPAIGNING GAINS MOMENTUM FOR THE FOURTH PHASE
Tamil-0041-9480	FOR HIS PART CONGRESS PRESIDENT RAHUL GANDHI HAS SOUGHT TO UNDERSCORE THE LINK BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND TERMS HIS TWENTY NINETEEN ELECTION AS A FIGHT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF INDIA AS AN INCLUSIVE AND PLURALISTIC COUNTRY
Tamil-0041-9481	MRGANDHI HAS KEPT THE SUSPENSE ALIVE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS SISTER PRIYANKA GANDHI VADRA CONTESTING AGAINST MRMODI IN UTTAR PRADESHS VARANASI CONSTITUENCY
Tamil-0041-9482	IF MSVADRA ENTERS THE FRAY AS A CANDIDATE IT WOULD DOUBTLESS ALTER SOME OF THE CALCULATIONS ABOUT THIS ELECTION
Tamil-0041-9483	THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS DECISION TO SUSPEND TRADE ACROSS THE LINE OF CONTROL BETWEEN JAMMU AND KASHMIR AND PAKISTANOCCUPIED KASHMIR IS BAD IN CONCEPTION AND COMES AT A PARTICULARLY FRAUGHT TIME
Tamil-0041-9484	ON APRIL EIGHTEEN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS ANNOUNCED THE SUSPENSION FROM MIDNIGHT OF TRADE AT THE TWO DESIGNATED POINTS AT SALAMABAD AND CHAKANDABAGH CITING CONCERNS ABOUT ILLEGAL WEAPONS NARCOTICS AND FAKE CURRENCY BEING TRANSPORTED INTO INDIA
Tamil-0041-9485	IT IS ALSO BEING ARGUED THAT THE ZEROTARIFF BARTER ARRANGEMENT IS BEING VIOLATED THROUGH UNDERINVOICING AND THE EXCHANGE OF THIRD PARTY ITEMS SUCH AS USORIGIN CALIFORNIA ALMONDS
Tamil-0041-9486	THE FIRST IS PRESUMABLY A WAY TO TRANSFER FUNDS AND THE SECOND WOULD BE TO EXPLOIT THE ZEROTARIFF TRADE SOMETHING BROUGHT UP BY TRADERS WHO OPERATE VIA THE WAGAH BORDER
Tamil-0041-9487	THE GOVERNMENTS CONCERNS MAY BE WELLFOUNDED BUT THE SOLUTION TO VIOLATIONS OF A TRADE AGREEMENT IS TO ENFORCE THE RULES STRINGENTLY NOT STOP EXCHANGE OF GOODS AND PUT AT RISK THE LIVELIHOOD OF COUNTLESS PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LOC
Tamil-0041-9488	ACCEPTING FAILURE
Tamil-0041-9489	WE DO NOT KNOW SUCCESS IF WE DO NOT KNOW FAILURE 
Tamil-0041-9490	RECOGNIZE THAT FAILURE IS PART OF SUCCESS LEARN FROM IT AND DO NOT LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN 
Tamil-0041-9491	UNDERSTAND THAT MOST BUSINESSES DO FAIL AND MANY GREAT IDEAS NEVER MAKE IT OFF THE GROUND IT IS A WAR OUT THERE
Tamil-0041-9492	ITS OKAY TO ASK FOR HELP
Tamil-0041-9493	YOU CANNOT DO IT ALONE MANY OF US HAVE A FEAR THAT ASKING FOR HELP MAKES US LOOK WEAK NOWING YOUR LIMITATIONS WILL HELP YOU BUILD YOUR NETWORK AND BECOME SUCCESSFUL
Tamil-0041-9494	BY NOT ASKING YOU WILL STRUGGLE MORE AND MIGHT ACTUALLY DEPRIVE SOMEONE THE JOY OF SHOWING YOU THAT THEY CARE AND WANT TO HELP
Tamil-0041-9495	LOSE THE EGO
Tamil-0041-9496	JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN A PARTICULAR AREA DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU STILL CANNOT LEARN FROM OTHERS 
Tamil-0041-9497	THE MORE YOU RESPECT OTHERS FOR THEIR KNOWLEDGE THE MORE YOU WILL GET RESPECT
Tamil-0041-9498	IT IS GREAT WHEN YOU ACHIEVE SUCCESS BUT NOT WHEN YOU GLOAT OR BRAG 
Tamil-0041-9499	ENJOY IT YOU EARNED IT BUT DO NOT TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL

Tamil-0042-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0042-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0042-9500	AT A PROTEST IN SRINAGAR AGAINST THE TRADE SUSPENSION FOR INSTANCE A LEADER OF THE CROSSLOC TRADERS ASSOCIATION ARGUED THAT THEY HAD IN FACT THEMSELVES BEEN SEEKING A FOOLPROOF MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT
Tamil-0042-9501	THE BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL ECONOMIES FROM THE CROSSLOC TRADE ARE BEYOND DOUBT
Tamil-0042-9502	IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SINCE THE BARTER TRADE COMMENCED ALONG TWO ROUTES ACROSS THE LOC IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EMPLOYMENT TO THE ORDER OF MORE THAN ONE LAKH DAYS HAD BEEN CREATED
Tamil-0042-9503	THE VOLUME OF TRADE OVER THE DECADE HAS CROSSED RUPEES SIX THOUSAND CRORE
Tamil-0042-9504	IT MUST BE KEPT IN MIND THAT THE TRADE IS MOSTLY OF LOCAL GOODS AND THOSE EMPLOYED INCLUDING IN THE TRANSPORTATION ARE FROM BORDER COMMUNITIES
Tamil-0042-9505	THE OPENING OF CROSSLOC TRADE WAS AMONG THE CONFIDENCEBUILDING MECHANISMS THAT FOLLOWED THE TWO THOUSAND THREE INDIAPAKISTAN CEASEFIRE ALONG THE LINE AND THAT INCLUDED A BUS SERVICE BETWEEN SRINAGAR AND MUZAFFARABAD IN POK
Tamil-0042-9506	THE HOPE OF THE MIDTWO THOUSANDS THAT PEOPLETOPEOPLE CONTACT BETWEEN THOSE LIVING IN JK AND POK WOULD OVER TIME BECOME OBSTRUCTIONFREE HAS FOR NOW FADED
Tamil-0042-9507	BUT THE LOC TRADE HAS HELD WITH JUST THE OCCASIONAL DISRUPTION
Tamil-0042-9508	THE CURRENT SUSPENSION COMES IN THE COURSE OF A SHRILL ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT THE RULING BJP IS RELENTLESSLY PULLING TOWARDS ITS HARD LINE ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS ARTICLE THREE SEVENTY ON THE SPECIAL STATUS OF JK
Tamil-0042-9509	THE GOVERNMENT HAS SENT UNSETTLING SIGNALS BY CLOSING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY BETWEEN UDHAMPUR AND BARAMULLA TO CIVILIAN TRAFFIC FOR TWO DAYS A WEEK TO SECURE THE MOVEMENT OF TROOP CONVOYS
Tamil-0042-9510	TO NOW SUMMARILY SUSPEND LOC TRADE IS TO INVITE SUSPICION THAT THE STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ALSO FOR POLITICAL REASONS
Tamil-0042-9511	THE SUSPENSION MUST BE URGENTLY REVOKED
Tamil-0042-9512	PRAGYA SINGH THAKUR MAY NOT BE THE FIRST PERSON TO CONTEST IN AN ELECTION DESPITE FACING SERIOUS CHARGES BUT HER CANDIDACY ON BEHALF OF THE BJP IN THE BHOPAL LOK SABHA CONSTITUENCY STANDS OUT AS EXCEPTIONALLY CONTROVERSIAL
Tamil-0042-9513	SHE IS ARRAIGNED AS THE PRIME ACCUSED AND PRINCIPAL CONSPIRATOR BEHIND THE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BLAST AT MALEGAON IN WHICH SIX PERSONS WERE KILLED
Tamil-0042-9514	IN OTHER WORDS A PERSON ACCUSED OF A TERRORIST ACT AND AGAINST WHOM CHARGES HAVE BEEN FRAMED UNDER THE UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES PREVENTION ACT IS BEING FIELDED AS A CANDIDATE BY A PARTY THAT WANTS TO UNDERSCORE ITS ANTITERRORISM CREDENTIALS
Tamil-0042-9515	WHILE MANY CANDIDATES MAY HAVE CRIMINAL CASES PENDING AGAINST THEM IT IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL TO FIND AMONG MAINSTREAM PARTY CONTESTANTS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PLANTING A BOMB TARGETING A COMMUNITY
Tamil-0042-9516	AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM WITH PRAGYA SINGHS CANDIDACY IS THAT SHE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN SOLELY AS A TOTEMIC REPRESENTATIVE OF AGGRESSIVE HINDUTVA NATIONALISM
Tamil-0042-9517	SHE WAS NOT PROMINENT AS A BJP MEMBER UNTIL SHE WAS NAMED THE CANDIDATE FOR BHOPAL WHERE SHE WILL TAKE ON SENIOR CONGRESS LEADER DIGVIJAYA SINGH
Tamil-0042-9518	IT IS ONE THING TO FIELD A POLITICAL LEADER WHO FACES CRIMINAL CHARGES BUT QUITE ANOTHER TO CREATE AN ELECTORAL CANDIDATE OUT OF A KEY TERROR SUSPECT
Tamil-0042-9519	IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FIELDING HER IS TO BOLSTER THE BJPS NARRATIVE THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY HINDU OR SAFFRON TERROR GROUP
Tamil-0042-9520	TWO BLASTS AT MALEGAON  THE SAMJHAUTA EXPRESS BOMBING NEAR PANIPAT FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE EXPLOSIONS AT MECCA MASJID IN HYDERABAD AND THE AJMER DARGAH WERE LINKED TO A FRINGE HINDU GROUP CALLED ABHINAV BHARAT BUT THE NIA HAD NEITHER THE POLITICAL BACKING NOR THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN CONVICTIONS
Tamil-0042-9521	TO NO ONES SURPRISE MSSINGH LOST LITTLE TIME IN EMBARRASSING THE BJP BY MAKING SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE CHIEF OF THE MUMBAI POLICE ANTITERRORIST SQUAD HEMANT KARKARE WHO WAS MARTYRED IN THE TWENTY SIX BY ELEVEN TERROR ATTACK
Tamil-0042-9522	ELECTION LAW AS IT STANDS TODAY DOES NOT BAR ONE FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES FROM CONTESTING EXCEPT THOSE CONVICTED OF SPECIFIED CLASSES OF OFFENCES OR THOSE THAT ENTAIL A SENTENCE OF AT LEAST TWO YEARS
Tamil-0042-9523	IF THE MERE PENDENCY OF A CASE WAS MADE A GROUND FOR DISQUALIFICATION A VINDICTIVE REGIME COULD GET ANY POLITICAL OPPONENT DISQUALIFIED BY MERELY SLAPPING A CRIMINAL CHARGE
Tamil-0042-9524	HOWEVER GIVEN THE TORTUOUS PROCESS OF TAKING A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION TO ITS CONCLUSION SOME HAVE MADE A CASE FOR ADVANCING THE STAGE AT WHICH DISQUALIFICATION KICKS IN  BY MAKING A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE TO RULE OUT OF THE CONTEST ANY PERSON AGAINST WHOM CHARGES HAVE BEEN FRAMED BY A COMPETENT COURT
Tamil-0042-9525	HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM
Tamil-0042-9526	PERSONALLY MY WIFE HAS BEEN MY BIGGEST FAN AND SUPPORTER SHE HAS BEEN THERE FOR ME DURING THE TOUGH TIMES AND THE GOOD ONES AS WELL 
Tamil-0042-9527	BUILDING A SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS IS VERY IMPORTANT
Tamil-0042-9528	WHETHER IT IS ONLINE OR INPERSON THE MORE SUPPORT THAT YOU HAVE THE GREATER CONFIDENCE YOU WILL HAVE 
Tamil-0042-9529	THE SUPPORT SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE TO BE BIG BUT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE MUTUAL TRUST AND RESPECT
Tamil-0042-9530	HAVE A PLAN B
Tamil-0042-9531	I ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN B MANY TIMES THINGS DO NOT GO AS PLANNED AND YOU NEED TO RESORT TO THE BACKUP PLAN 
Tamil-0042-9532	IN SEVERAL INSTANCES THE BACKUP ENDS UP BEING BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL
Tamil-0042-9533	NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU HAVE A PLAN BUT A METHOD OF QUICKLY PUTTING IT INTO ACTION QUICKLY IF PLAN A GETS DERAILED BY THE UNFORESEEN
Tamil-0042-9534	CHANGE IS PART OF LIFE YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT 
Tamil-0042-9535	ACCEPTING AND UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE OR BUSINESS WILL NOT BE EXACTLY AS YOU PLANNED WILL HELP YOU ADAPT AND MAKE THE BEST OF A GIVEN SITUATION

Tamil-0043-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0043-9536	IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH LAWMAKERS TO AGREE TO THIS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE BUT IT CAN BE A PRINCIPLE POLITICAL PARTIES ADOPT ON THEIR OWN
Tamil-0043-9537	THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF UNION MINISTERS RESIGNING FROM OFFICE AS SOON AS CHARGES WERE FRAMED AGAINST THEM
Tamil-0043-9538	THERE IS NO HARM IN EXTENDING THIS NORM TO THE SELECTION OF CANDIDATES
Tamil-0043-9539	THE FIRST PHASE OF VOTING ON THURSDAY TO ELECT THE SEVENTEEN TH LOK SABHA WITNESSED ENTHUSIASTIC PARTICIPATION OF VOTERS IN NINETY ONE LOK SABHA CONSTITUENCIES ACROSS TWENTY STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES
Tamil-0043-9540	IN THIS OPENING PHASE OF A TOTAL OF SEVEN THE CHALLENGES IN ENSURING A FREE AND FAIR POLL AS WELL AS THE TREND OF HIGH ENTHUSIASM AMONG VOTERS HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED
Tamil-0043-9541	THE DRIVE OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA AGAINST MALPRACTICES LED AHEAD OF THE FIRST PHASE TO SEIZURES WORTH RUPEES TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CRORE OF CASH LIQUOR DRUGS AND OTHER ITEMS MEANT TO UNDULY INFLUENCE VOTERS
Tamil-0043-9542	THE ECIS DECISION TO BAN THE RELEASE OF A BIOPIC ON PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI AND ITS ORDER TO STOP THE BROADCAST OF POLITICAL CONTENT ON A TV CHANNEL MEANT FOR HIS PROPAGANDA WERE MEASURES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
Tamil-0043-9543	BUT THE TRAIL OF SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE DEFIANCE OF ITS PREVIOUS DIRECTIVES BY THE RULING DISPENSATION AND MRMODI HIMSELF RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ECIS EFFECTIVENESS IN BEING A NEUTRAL AND FAIR ARBITER
Tamil-0043-9544	THE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTIONS ARISING OUT OF DOUBTS ABOUT EVMS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED WITH ONE HUNDRED PERCENT VOTER VERIFIABLE PAPER AUDIT TRAILS FOLLOWED BY A SUPREME COURTDIRECTED INCREASE IN THEIR RANDOM COUNTING RATE FROM ONE MACHINE TO FIVE PER ASSEMBLY CONSTITUENCYSEGMENT
Tamil-0043-9545	BUT DOUBTS ARISING OUT OF THE ECIS CONDUCT FALL IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY AND IT NEEDS TO DO MORE TO REASSURE VOTERS THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT VITIATED BY PARTISANSHIP
Tamil-0043-9546	THE SEEMINGLY BIASED MOVES BY CENTRAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT TARGETING ONLY OPPOSITION LEADERS POINT TO THE POSSIBLE MISUSE OF OFFICE BY THE RULING PARTY TO TARGET OPPONENTS
Tamil-0043-9547	MRMODIS APPEAL TO VOTERS IN THE NAME OF SOLDIERS  SOMETHING THE ECI HAD EXPLICITLY WARNED AGAINST  WAS UNFORTUNATE AS WAS THE COMMISSIONS FAILURE TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION
Tamil-0043-9548	WHILE THE ECI MUST URGENTLY RESPOND TO MCC VIOLATIONS THE GOVERNMENT MUST ACT FAIRLY
Tamil-0043-9549	ANDHRA PRADESH ARUNACHAL PRADESH SIKKIM AND PARTS OF ODISHA ALSO VOTED TO ELECT THEIR STATE ASSEMBLIES
Tamil-0043-9550	TRIPURA AND WEST BENGAL TOPPED IN TURNOUT WITH EIGHTY ONE PERCENT AND EIGHTY ONE PERCENT RESPECTIVELY
Tamil-0043-9551	THIS IS THE FIRST GENERAL ELECTION WITH VVPATS ATTACHED TO ALL EVMSACCORDING TO THE ECI ONE PERCENT OF VVPATS POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BALLOT UNITS AND POINT SIX ONE PERCENT OF THE CONTROL UNITS OF EVMS HAD TO BE REPLACED ON THURSDAY
Tamil-0043-9552	STRAY INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE WERE REPORTED IN ANDHRA PRADESH BUT IN JAMMU AND KASHMIR THE POLLING WENT RELATIVELY PEACEFULLY
Tamil-0043-9553	IN THE JAMMU CONSTITUENCY SEVENTY TWO PERCENT POLLING WAS RECORDED WHILE IN THE VALLEYS BARAMULLA CONSTITUENCY THE FIGURE WAS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT MARGINALLY LOWER THAN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIGURES
Tamil-0043-9554	ISOLATED COMPLAINTS REGARDING MISMANAGEMENT AROSE IN SOME PARTS BUT BY AND LARGE THE FIRST PHASE WENT ON WELL AND UPHELD INDIAS REPUTATION IN MANAGING WHAT IS THE WORLDS LARGEST DEMOCRATIC EXERCISE
Tamil-0043-9555	IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG SUMMER
Tamil-0043-9556	ON APRIL TEN  THE EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE COLLABORATION SHOWED THE WORLD THE UNSEEABLE THE VERY FIRST IMAGE OF A BLACK HOLE
Tamil-0043-9557	OF COURSE THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF CANNOT BE SEEN BECAUSE LIGHT CANNOT ESCAPE ITS INTENSE GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
Tamil-0043-9558	THE SOCALLED EVENT HORIZON THAT ENVELOPS THE BLACK HOLE IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN AND ANY OBJECT TRANSGRESSING THIS BOUNDARY IS LOST
Tamil-0043-9559	JUST OUTSIDE IS A REGION WHERE A PHOTON LIGHT QUANTUM CAN ORBIT THE BLACK HOLE WITHOUT FALLING IN
Tamil-0043-9560	THIS IS CALLED THE LAST PHOTON RING AND THIS IS WHAT THE EHT IMAGED SEEING IN EFFECT THE SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK HOLE
Tamil-0043-9561	LOOK AT THE POSITIVE
Tamil-0043-9562	THERE IS ALWAYS POSITIVE IN EVERY SITUATION NO MATTER HOW BAD THINGS MAY SEEM TO BE 
Tamil-0043-9563	YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND IT AND FOCUS ON THAT 
Tamil-0043-9564	NEGATIVE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS DO NOT PRODUCE SUCCESS
Tamil-0043-9565	AVOID UNHEALTHY HABITS
Tamil-0043-9566	SMOKING AND ALCOHOL KILL PRODUCTIVITY IF YOU HAVE TO GO FOR A SMOKE BREAK OR MAKE A TRIP TO THE BAR YOU ARE NOT FOCUSING ON YOUR GOALS 
Tamil-0043-9567	USING THAT TIME KILLS PRODUCTIVITY AND CREATIVE THOUGHT IN ADDITION TO YOUR BODY AND MIND
Tamil-0043-9568	AVOID STRESSFUL SITUATIONS
Tamil-0043-9569	STRESS SAPS YOUR ENERGY AND MOTIVATION IT FILLS YOUR HEAD WITH UNHEALTHY THOUGHTS 
Tamil-0043-9570	BY AVOIDING THESE SITUATIONS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HAVE MORE ENERGY TO MOVE FORWARD

Tamil-0045-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0045-9608	THESE MESSAGES AND WEATHER ALERTS CAN BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH TELEVISION MOBILE PHONE MESSAGING AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMSURBAN LOCAL BODIES IN PARTICULAR HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR THE LARGE NUMBER OF VULNERABLE CITY DWELLERS
Tamil-0045-9609	YET FEW CITIES HAVE DRAWN UP PROPER HEAT ACTION PLANS TO RESPOND TO EXTREME WEATHER OR MADE THEM PUBLIC
Tamil-0045-9610	DURING THE CURRENT YEAR THERE IS APPREHENSION THAT THE FOCUS OF ADMINISTRATORS WILL MAINLY BE ON THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTIONS RELEGATING THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK OF HEAT WAVES TO THE BACKBURNER
Tamil-0045-9611	WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF ADVANCE WEATHER ALERTS THERE IS NO REASON WHY LOCAL BODIES CANNOT INSTITUTE REMEDIAL MEASURES
Tamil-0045-9612	MITIGATING THE EFFECT OF HEAT WAVES IS VITAL TO ENSURING A HIGH TURNOUT IN THE ELECTIONS BY MAKING IT SAFE FOR VOTERS
Tamil-0045-9613	INDIA IS LOOKING AT ANOTHER UNCERTAIN MONSOON BRINGING INTO SHARP RELIEF THE NEGLECTED POTENTIAL OF DECENTRALISED WATERHARVESTING
Tamil-0045-9614	IT IS MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FARMERS SUGGESTED THE WIDER ADOPTION OF BOTH RAINWATER HARVESTING AND AQUIFER RECHARGE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE IRRIGATION FOR SMALL FARMERS
Tamil-0045-9615	IT IS TIME TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL HELP COMMUNITIES ACHIEVE RESILIENCE
Tamil-0045-9616	THIS WEEK BRITISH PRAGMATISM FINALLY FOUND ITS VOICE IN THE UKS COMPLEX EXIT PROCESS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION
Tamil-0045-9617	THE GOVERNMENTS DELIBERATIONS OVER A WITHDRAWAL HAD BEEN HELD HOSTAGE BY THE ENGLISH NATIONALISTS AMONG THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO DEMAND AN EXIT SANS AN AGREEMENT
Tamil-0045-9618	PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY WHO HAD LONG INSISTED THAT NO DEAL WITH BRUSSELS WAS BETTER THAN A BAD DEAL DECLARED ON TUESDAY THAT LONDON WOULD NOT QUIT WITHOUT AN ACCORD
Tamil-0045-9619	SHE CLARIFIED SHE WOULD SEEK AN EXTENSION OF THE APRIL TWELVE DEADLINE WHICH SHE DID DULY ON FRIDAY
Tamil-0045-9620	PARLIAMENTARIANS ARE TRYING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE GOVERNMENT TO AVOID A NODEAL BREXIT  IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE COMMONS BY A SLIM MAJORITY AND AWAITS ITS FINAL STAGES
Tamil-0045-9621	THE GOVERNMENT HAD OPPOSED THESE MOVES INITIATED BY CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR MPS IN RECENT PARLIAMENTARY VOTES
Tamil-0045-9622	IN A BOLD BUT RISKY GAMBIT MSMAY BEGAN TALKS WITH LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBYN TO HELP BREAK THE DEADLOCK
Tamil-0045-9623	WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS INSISTED IT REMAINS AGAINST A CUSTOMS UNION THE TALKS WITH LABOUR WHICH STRONGLY ADVOCATES THIS ALONG WITH WORKER AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS MEAN THAT THIS IS INEVITABLY ON THE TABLE
Tamil-0045-9624	THIS IS RESISTED VEHEMENTLY BY MANY CONSERVATIVES
Tamil-0045-9625	FEW SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT MSMAY AND MRCORBYN WILL AGREE TO A DEAL
Tamil-0045-9626	EQUALLY THE PRIME MINISTER WILL BE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY THE INFURIATED HARDLINE EUROSCEPTICS WITHIN HER PARTY TO NOT CONCEDE TOO MUCH
Tamil-0045-9627	THAT WOULD FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO ASK PARLIAMENT ONCE AGAIN TO FIND A MAJORITY FOR ANY ONE OF SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING THE THRICEREJECTED WITHDRAWAL ACCORD
Tamil-0045-9628	THESE INDICATIVE VOTES FAILED TO DELIVER A MAJORITY TO JOIN AN EU CUSTOMS UNION OFFER A SECOND REFERENDUM OR REVOKE BREXIT
Tamil-0045-9629	BUT THESE PROPOSALS ARE CERTAIN TO BE PUT BEFORE PARLIAMENT WITH MODIFICATIONS DRAWN FROM INPUTS ACROSS DIFFERENT PARTIES
Tamil-0045-9630	CALLS FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ONCE VOICED RATHER MUTELY BY HARDCORE REMAINERS HAVE EMERGED AS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL
Tamil-0045-9631	THE PREVAILING STATE OF CHAOS AND CONFUSION ALMOST THREE YEARS AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN REFERENDUM HAS CAUSED IMMENSE FRUSTRATION AMONG BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE
Tamil-0045-9632	BUT WITH PARLIAMENT HAVING ASSUMED CHARGE OF THE PROCESS  WHICH SEEMS IRREVERSIBLE  THERE IS REASON TO HOPE FOR CLARITY AND CERTAINTY
Tamil-0045-9633	FIRST ON THE LIST BUT BY NO MEANS THE WORST IS OVERCONFIDENCE 
Tamil-0045-9634	DONT GET ME WRONG HERE CONFIDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING YOU DO 
Tamil-0045-9635	CONFIDENCE CAN BE THE KEY TO SUCCESS BUT OVERCONFIDENCE THAT CAN BE A DETRIMENT
Tamil-0045-9636	HAVING AN OVERCONFIDENT ATTITUDE CAN LEAVE PEOPLE OPEN TO WEAK POINTS IN THEMSELVES AND THEIR BUSINESS THAT THEY HAVENT EVEN CONSIDERED AS BEING WEAK YET
Tamil-0045-9637	IF YOURE OVERLYCONFIDENT IN THAT YOUR BUSINESS OR YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS PERFECT YOURE UNABLE TO WORK ON YOUR OWN WEAKNESSES AND AREAS WHERE YOU CAN IMPROVE THERE WILL BE AT LEAST ONE AREA ALWAYS
Tamil-0045-9638	ITS IMPORTANT TO STILL CONSIDER AREAS WHERE YOU CAN IMPROVE AND ALWAYS BE IMPROVING RATHER THAN NEGLECT IT BECAUSE YOU THINK YOUVE ALREADY COVERED IT COMPLETELY 
Tamil-0045-9639	NO MATTER WHAT IT MAY BE EVERY LITTLE DETAIL PUSHES YOU ONE STEP CLOSER TO SUCCESS

Tamil-0046-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0046-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0046-9640	ADMITTEDLY MSMAYS COMMITMENT TO A CROSSPARTY APPROACH TO DELIVER BREXIT HAS COME RATHER LATE IN THE DAY
Tamil-0046-9641	BUT HER WILLINGNESS TO PUT COUNTRY ABOVE PARTY AT LAST HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PREVENT THE CATASTROPHE OF BRITAIN GOING OVER THE CLIFF WHEN THE DATE OF DEPARTURE EVENTUALLY APPROACHES
Tamil-0046-9642	THAT IS NO SMALL COMFORT GOING BY THE GOVERNMENTS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE STEP BESIDES PROTECTING THE PEACE ACROSS IRELAND
Tamil-0046-9643	RAHUL GANDHIS DECISION TO CHOOSE WAYANAD IN KERALA IN ADDITION TO AMETHI IN UTTAR PRADESH TO CONTEST COULD WELL BE A DEFINING MOMENT IN THIS ELECTION
Tamil-0046-9644	THOUGH WAYANAD WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS THE DECISION WAS NONETHELESS SURPRISING AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT WOULD BE NOT HIS NATIONALLEVEL IDEOLOGICAL RIVAL THE BJP BUT A PARTY OF THE LEFT WHICH IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR A SECULAR ALTERNATIVE TO THE RULING FORMATION
Tamil-0046-9645	THIS PARADOX COULD TURN OUT TO BE A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN THE EMERGENCE OF A NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST THE BJP BECAUSE MANY PARTIES THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE BJP ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER
Tamil-0046-9646	MRGANDHIS GAMBIT AMPLIFIES THAT CONTRADICTION AND MARKS A RUPTURE BETWEEN THE CONGRESS AND THE LEFT FRONT  FIERCE OPPONENTS IN KERALA BUT NATURAL PARTNERS AT THE CENTRE
Tamil-0046-9647	THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE CONGRESS HAD KEPT AN ARMS LENGTH FROM THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE POLITICS IN KERALA WHERE ITS STATE UNIT AND THE LEFT ARE FACE TO FACE
Tamil-0046-9648	THE EXIGENCIES OF NATIONAL POLITICS SHAPE THEIR COOPERATION ELSEWHERE
Tamil-0046-9649	ONLY RECENTLY ON MRGANDHIS WATCH THE CONGRESS WAS IN SEATSHARING TALKS WITH THE LEFT IN WEST BENGAL
Tamil-0046-9650	THOUGH THE CONGRESS HAS SAID MRGANDHIS CANDIDATURE IS NOT AGAINST THE LEFT THE LATTER HAS BEEN BRUTAL IN ITS REACTION
Tamil-0046-9651	THE CONGRESS CLAIMED THE FORAY SIGNALLED MRGANDHIS COMMITMENT TO ALL REGIONS
Tamil-0046-9652	BUT THE CHOICE OF KERALA RATHER THAN KARNATAKA WHERE THE CONGRESS IS LOCKED IN A DIRECT BATTLE WITH THE BJP IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
Tamil-0046-9653	IF THE LEFT FRONTALLY ATTACKED THE CONGRESS THE BJP WAS DISPARAGING
Tamil-0046-9654	AMIT SHAH REMARKED MRGANDHI FEARED HE WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY AMETHIS VOTERS AND NARENDRA MODI IN A STATEMENT WITH COMMUNAL OVERTONES SAID MRGANDHI CHOSE THE SEAT BECAUSE HINDUS WERE IN A MINORITY THERE
Tamil-0046-9655	BY FIELDING MRGANDHI FROM WAYANAD THE CONGRESS HAS TAKEN A VIEW THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF ALLIANCES ARE NOW SECONDARY TO ITS PUSH TO MAXIMISE ITS INDIVIDUAL TALLY
Tamil-0046-9656	THE CONGRESS HAS STRONG ALLIANCES IN MAHARASHTRA TAMIL NADU AND BIHAR BUT A SHAKY ONE IN KARNATAKA
Tamil-0046-9657	ITS UP
Tamil-0046-9658	AMBITIONS WERE REJECTED BY THE SPBSP AXIS AND DIFFERENCES PERSIST WITHIN THE PARTY ON ALIGNING WITH THE AAP IN DELHI
Tamil-0046-9659	AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR ELECTIONS THE CONGRESS BECAME THE FULCRUM OF A NATIONAL COALITION WHICH WAS BOUND BY A BROAD COMMITMENT TO A PLURALIST INDIA AS OPPOSED TO HINDUTVAS EXCLUSIVIST AND MAJORITARIAN POLITICS
Tamil-0046-9660	THE LEFT HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ITS FORMATION BUT ENDED THE EXPERIMENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OVER DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS ON THE NUCLEAR DEAL
Tamil-0046-9661	STATELEVEL COMPULSIONS HAVE LED REGIONAL PARTIES TO CROSS FROM THE BJP TO THE CONGRESS AND VICE VERSA BUT THE PRIMARY FAULTLINE IS POLITICAL MOBILISATION ALONG RELIGIOUS LINES
Tamil-0046-9662	WITHOUT CLARITY OF CONCEPT ON ADDRESSING THIS FAULTLINE THERE CAN BE NO EFFECTIVE COOPERATION AMONG NONBJP PARTIES
Tamil-0046-9663	THOUGH IT IS UNFAIR TO PUT THE ENTIRE ONUS OF AGGREGATING NONBJP POLITICS ON MRGANDHI HIS CANDIDACY IN WAYANAD CAN DO NOTHING FOR THE LARGER SECULAR CAUSE
Tamil-0046-9664	THE DRAMA OF GOVERNMENTFORMATION AND CABINET SHUFFLE AMID SHIFTS IN POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE IN GOA SERVES AS A REMINDER OF THE DARK SHADOWS OF MANOEUVRE AND INTRIGUE THAT LURK WITHIN INDIAN DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0046-9665	GREED IS ONE OF THOSE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES PEOPLE HAVE NORMALLY AFTER THEY BECOME RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL
Tamil-0046-9666	THE MONEY AND POWER GOES TO THEIR HEAD WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO THEM CHASING MORE OF IT AND COMPLETELY DISREGARDING THEIR ORIGINAL GOALS
Tamil-0046-9667	ITS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN BUSINESS AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY END UP DESTROYING THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF IT
Tamil-0046-9668	SURE YOU CAN NATURALLY BE GREEDY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
Tamil-0046-9669	THATS WHY YOULL SEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR START BUSINESSES WITH NOTHING BUT DOLLAR SIGNS IN THEIR EYES
Tamil-0046-9670	THEY WANT THE MONEY THEY WANT THE POWER BUT THEY HAVE NO PASSION FOR HELPING OTHERS 
Tamil-0046-9671	SO GREED IS DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE POTENTIALLY BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ACHIEVING SUCCESS IN THEIR LIVES
Tamil-0046-9672	THE FIRST TWO GOALS PEOPLE HAVE INVOLVE MONEY AND POWER WHATS YOUR THIRD GOAL FORGET THE FIRST TWO AND FOCUS ON THAT ONE

Tamil-0047-9673	GOA POLITICS HAS FOR LONG BEEN AN ARENA OF OVERNIGHT DESERTION AND DEFECTION
Tamil-0047-9674	BUT THE DEATH OF CHIEF MINISTER MANOHAR PARRIKAR EARLIER LAST MONTH AND THE MIDNIGHT SWEARINGIN OF PRAMOD SAWANT CAME AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE RULING BJPS AGGRESSIVELY EXPANSIONARY PHASE
Tamil-0047-9675	IN THIS POSTTWENTY FOURTEEN PHASE THE BJP HAS BEEN UNABASHED ABOUT TARGETING ITS ALLIES AS ITS PARTNER IN GOA THE MAHARASHTRAWADI GOMANTAK PARTY FOUND OUT LAST WEEK
Tamil-0047-9676	TWO OF THE MGPS THREE MLAS IN THE ASSEMBLY JOINED THE BJP
Tamil-0047-9677	ONE OF THEM MANOHAR AJGAONKAR WAS APPOINTED DEPUTY CHIEF MINISTER HOURS LATER REPLACING SUDIN DHAVALIKAR THE THIRD MGP LAWMAKER
Tamil-0047-9678	THE BREAKAWAY FACTION CONSTITUTED A TWOTHIRDS MAJORITY IN THE MGP LEGISLATURE PARTY WHICH JUST MIGHT SAFEGUARD THE MANOEUVRE FROM THE ANTIDEFECTION PROVISIONS OF THE LAW
Tamil-0047-9679	THE SPLIT OF THE MGP AND THE MERGER OF THE SPLINTER GROUP WITH THE BJP WERE ALL CARRIED OUT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WITH SPEAKER MICHAEL LOBO WORKING HIS OFFICE THROUGH ODD HOURS AS IF IT WERE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Tamil-0047-9680	IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ASSEMBLY ELECTION THE CONGRESS HAD EMERGED AS THE SINGLE LARGEST PARTY WITH SEVENTEEN SEATS IN THE FOURTY MEMBER HOUSE AND THE BJP HAD THIRTEEN SEATS
Tamil-0047-9681	THROUGH A SERIES OF MANIPULATIVE ACTS THAT RAISED QUESTIONS OF POLITICAL PROPRIETY THE BJP MANAGED TO FORM THE GOVERNMENT
Tamil-0047-9682	TO LEAD THE RICKETY COALITION WITH THE MGP AND THE GOA FORWARD PARTY THE BJP BROUGHT PARRIKAR TO THE STATE
Tamil-0047-9683	HIS DEATH TRIGGERED THE CURRENT ROUND OF JOSTLING FOR POWER
Tamil-0047-9684	THE BJP SOUGHT TO LURE MLAS FROM SUPPORTING PARTIES TO REDUCE THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING POWER EVEN AS THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS BEING FORMED
Tamil-0047-9685	THE MGP WAS TRYING TO PREEMPT THE BJP BID BY SUSPENDING ONE LAWMAKER TO FORECLOSE THE OPTION OF A SPLIT IN THE LEGISLATURE PARTY WHEN THE BJP STRUCK FIRST
Tamil-0047-9686	THE EPISODE HAS UNDERSCORED GOAS DISREPUTE AS A THEATRE OF ABSURDITIES OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0047-9687	THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THE BJP IS NOW TARGETING MLAS OF THE GFP AND EVEN THE CONGRESS
Tamil-0047-9688	THE BJP AND THE CONGRESS HAVE FOURTEEN MLAS EACH
Tamil-0047-9689	THE GFP LAWMAKERS BOYCOTTED THE SWEARINGIN OF MRAJGAONKAR WHO HAS HOPPED FROM THE CONGRESS TO THE BJP TO THE MGP AND BACK TO THE BJP
Tamil-0047-9690	SOME BJP LEADERS HAVE RIGHTLY WARNED THAT SUCH MACHINATIONS WILL UNDERMINE THE PARTYS CREDIBILITY
Tamil-0047-9691	GFP LEADER VIJAI SARDESAI HAS SOUGHT CLARITY FROM THE CHIEF MINISTER ON HIS POLITICAL PLANS
Tamil-0047-9692	IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER COMBINATION WILL NOT INSPIRE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE PEOPLE
Tamil-0047-9693	IF GOA IS NOT TO WITNESS A SEQUENCE OF PARTYHOPPING IN SEARCH OF MINISTERIAL BERTHS AND LOAVES OF OFFICE A FRESH ELECTION MIGHT BE THE ONLY ANSWER
Tamil-0047-9694	THE TRAGIC DEATH OF SIX PEOPLE WHO ENTERED A SEPTIC TANK IN TAMIL NADUS SRIPERUMBUDUR TOWN IS A GRIM REMINDER THAT SANITATION REMAINS A LOWPRIORITY AREA DESPITE THE HIGH POLITICAL PROFILE OF SWACHH BHARAT
Tamil-0047-9695	PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCIENCE OF MANAGING SEPTIC TANKS CONTINUES TO BE POOR AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP LABOUR TO CLEAN THESE STRUCTURES HAS SLOWED EFFORTS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN SAFELY REMOVE AND TRANSPORT THE WASTE
Tamil-0047-9696	SANITATION THUS REMAINS A CHALLENGE IN THOUSANDS OF UNSEWERED TOWNS
Tamil-0047-9697	WHAT SETS THE INCIDENT APART FROM THE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF PEOPLE DYING OF ASPHYXIATION IN THE TANKS IS THAT SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY AND NOT WORKERS
Tamil-0047-9698	AS A GROUP OF FROGS WAS TRAVELING THROUGH THE WOODS TWO OF THEM FELL INTO A DEEP PIT 
Tamil-0047-9699	WHEN THE OTHER FROGS CROWDED AROUND THE PIT AND SAW HOW DEEP IT WAS THEY TOLD THE TWO FROGS THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE LEFT FOR THEM
Tamil-0047-9700	HOWEVER THE TWO FROGS DECIDED TO IGNORE WHAT THE OTHERS WERE SAYING AND THEY PROCEEDED TO TRY AND JUMP OUT OF THE PIT 
Tamil-0047-9701	DESPITE THEIR EFFORTS THE GROUP OF FROGS AT THE TOP OF THE PIT WERE STILL SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD JUST GIVE UP 
Tamil-0047-9702	THAT THEY WOULD NEVER MAKE IT OUT
Tamil-0047-9703	EVENTUALLY ONE OF THE FROGS TOOK HEED TO WHAT THE OTHERS WERE SAYING AND HE GAVE UP FALLING DOWN TO HIS DEATH THE OTHER FROG CONTINUED TO JUMP AS HARD AS HE COULD AGAIN THE CROWD OF FROGS YELLED AT HIM TO STOP THE PAIN AND JUST DIE
Tamil-0047-9704	HE JUMPED EVEN HARDER AND FINALLY MADE IT OUT WHEN HE GOT OUT THE OTHER FROGS SAID DID YOU NOT HEAR US
Tamil-0047-9705	THE FROG EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT HE WAS DEAF HE THOUGHT THEY WERE ENCOURAGING HIM THE ENTIRE TIME
Tamil-0047-9706	MORAL OF THE STORY
Tamil-0047-9707	PEOPLES WORDS CAN HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON OTHERS LIVES THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY BEFORE IT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IT MIGHT JUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

Tamil-0048-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0048-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0048-9708	THREE PEOPLE COLLAPSED WHILE INSPECTING THEIR RESIDENTIAL SEPTIC TANK AND OTHERS WHO TRIED TO SAVE THEM ALSO PERISHED
Tamil-0048-9709	ALTHOUGH WORKERS WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THIS CASE IT CONFIRMS TAMIL NADUS ABYSMAL OVERALL RECORD AT RAISING SANITATION STANDARDS
Tamil-0048-9710	SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN THE FIRST LAW WAS PASSED AGAINST MANUAL CLEANING THERE WERE AT LEAST ONE FOURTY FOUR WORKER DEATHS IN TAMIL NADU AS OF NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DATA REPORTED TO THE CENTRE FOR GRANT OF COMPENSATION
Tamil-0048-9711	KARNATAKA UTTAR PRADESH AND PUNJAB ALSO FARED BADLY WITH A CUMULATIVE TOLL OF ONE FOURTY SIX LIVES LOST DURING THAT PERIOD
Tamil-0048-9712	BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A GROSS UNDERESTIMATE SINCE THE SAFAI KARMACHARI ANDOLAN WHICH HAS LITIGATED IN THE SUPREME COURT SEEKING TO AGGRESSIVELY PROSECUTE OFFENDERS CONTENDS THAT SEPTIC TANK CLEANING CLAIMED NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED LIVES BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN
Tamil-0048-9713	MORE REPORTS OF DEATHS CONTINUE TO COME IN
Tamil-0048-9714	EVERY DEATH OF A MANUAL WORKER REPRESENTS A CRIME SINCE THE PROHIBITION OF EMPLOYMENT AS MANUAL SCAVENGERS AND THEIR REHABILITATION ACT TWENTY THIRTEEN MAKES THE USE OF SUCH LABOUR TO CLEAN SEPTIC TANKS AN OFFENCE PUNISHABLE WITH IMPRISONMENT OF TWO YEARS OR WITH A FINE OF RUPEES TWO LAKH OR BOTH EVEN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
Tamil-0048-9715	IF STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE OFFENDERS THEY ARE ALSO SLOW TO ADOPT NEWER TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS FAECAL SLUDGE TREATMENT PLANTS FSTP WHICH CAN BE COMBINED WITH OMNIPROCESSORS FOR SAFE TREATMENT OF WASTE
Tamil-0048-9716	FOR THE TASK OF CLEANING THE TANKS INDIGENOUS INNOVATION IN ROBOTICS LOOKS PROMISING
Tamil-0048-9717	A PROTOTYPE IS PLANNED TO BE TESTED BY THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS AND SUCH DEVICES CAN POTENTIALLY TRANSFORM SANITATION IN INDIA AND OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
Tamil-0048-9718	BUT THE PACE OF ADOPTION WILL DEPEND ON THE PRIORITY THAT GOVERNMENTS ACCORD TO THE LONGNEGLECTED PROBLEM
Tamil-0048-9719	LAST YEAR TAMIL NADU AND SOME OTHER STATES NOTABLY ANDHRA PRADESH AND ODISHA ANNOUNCED PLANS TO SCALE UP FSTP INFRASTRUCTURE
Tamil-0048-9720	THIS IS A TASK THAT DESERVES THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE AND NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED ON DEADLINE
Tamil-0048-9721	WHAT HAPPENED IN SRIPERUMBUDUR HIGHLIGHTS THE HEAVY PRICE THAT COMMUNITIES PAY FOR THE LACK OF SCIENTIFIC SANITATION
Tamil-0048-9722	IF GOVERNMENTS REMAIN APATHETIC CITIZENS WOULD EXPECT THE COURTS TO STEP IN TO UPHOLD THE LAW AGAINST MANUAL SCAVENGING AND MAKE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS ACCOUNTABLE
Tamil-0048-9723	THE SCIENCE ON SANITATION HAS ADVANCED AND POLICY MUST URGENTLY CATCH UP
Tamil-0048-9724	BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY CHIEF MAYAWATI ONCE AGAIN ASSERTED THIS WEEK SHE IS A CONTENDER FOR THE POST OF PRIME MINISTER THOUGH SHE WILL NOT BE CONTESTING IN THE LOK SABHA POLLS HERSELF
Tamil-0048-9725	SHE ALSO LOST NO OPPORTUNITY TO POSITION HERSELF EQUIDISTANT FROM THE CONGRESS AND THE BJP THE TWO NATIONAL PARTIES AT THE OPPOSITE POLES OF THE ELECTORAL CONTEST THIS YEAR
Tamil-0048-9726	MUCH MORE THAN HER ALLIANCE PARTNER FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN UTTAR PRADESH THE SAMAJWADI PARTY EFFECTIVELY LED BY AKHILESH YADAV SHE HAS DISCOUNTED ANY NEED TO SEEK CONGRESS SUPPORT TO GIVE GREATER BALLAST TO THE FIGHT AGAINST THE BJP
Tamil-0048-9727	UNLIKE MRYADAV SHE HAS REFRAINED FROM GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE TOO CONSIDERS THE BJP A BIGGER THREAT TO THEIR SOCIAL JUSTICE POLITICS RELATIVE TO THE CONGRESS
Tamil-0048-9728	THE BSPSPRASHTRIYA LOK DAL ALLIANCE IN UP
Tamil-0048-9729	WILL NOT CONTEST IN AMETHI AND RAE BARELI THE CONSTITUENCIES OF RAHUL GANDHI AND SONIA GANDHI RESPECTIVELY
Tamil-0048-9730	WHEN THE CONGRESS SOUGHT TO RECIPROCATE THE GESTURE BY ANNOUNCING IT WOULD NOT FIELD CANDIDATES AGAINST THE SENIOR LEADERS OF THE ALLIANCE THE BSP CHIEF WAS STINGING IN HER REBUFF
Tamil-0048-9731	POSITIONING HERSELF POLITICALLY VISAVIS THE CONGRESS AT A TIME WHEN THE BJP IS DOMINANT HAS NOT BEEN EASY
Tamil-0048-9732	FOR THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN MADHYA PRADESH CHHATTISGARH AND RAJASTHAN LAST YEAR MSMAYAWATIS PREPOLL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS WERE HALFHEARTED AND DOOMED
Tamil-0048-9733	SOME TIME AGO A MAN PUNISHED HIS THREEYEAROLD DAUGHTER FOR WASTING A ROLL OF GOLD WRAPPING PAPER 
Tamil-0048-9734	MONEY WAS TIGHT AND HE BECAME INFURIATED WHEN THE CHILD TRIED TO DECORATE A BOX TO PUT UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE
Tamil-0048-9735	NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE GIRL BROUGHT THE GIFT TO HER FATHER THE NEXT MORNING AND SAID THIS IS FOR YOU DADDY
Tamil-0048-9736	THE MAN BECAME EMBARRASSED BY HIS OVERREACTION EARLIER BUT HIS RAGE CONTINUE WHEN HE SAW THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY 
Tamil-0048-9737	HE YELLED AT HER DONT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEONE A PRESENT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING INSIDE
Tamil-0048-9738	THE LITTLE GIRL LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND CRIED
Tamil-0048-9739	OH DADDY ITS NOT EMPTY AT ALL I BLEW KISSES INTO THE BOX THEYRE ALL FOR YOU DADDY
Tamil-0048-9740	THE FATHER WAS CRUSHED HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HIS LITTLE GIRL AND HE BEGGED FOR HER FORGIVENESS
Tamil-0048-9741	ONLY A SHORT TIME LATER AN ACCIDENT TOOK THE LIFE OF THE CHILD
Tamil-0048-9742	HER FATHER KEPT THE GOLD BOX BY HIS BED FOR MANY YEARS AND WHENEVER HE WAS DISCOURAGED HE WOULD TAKE OUT AN IMAGINARY KISS AND REMEMBER THE LOVE OF THE CHILD WHO HAD PUT IT THERE
Tamil-0048-9743	MORAL OF THE STORY LOVE IS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT IN THE WORLD

Tamil-0049-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0049-9744	THE BSP ENDED UP WITH AN ALLIANCE WITH AJIT JOGIS JANTA CONGRESS CHHATTISGARH THAT CUT INTO THE TRADITIONAL CONGRESS BASE IN THE STATE
Tamil-0049-9745	THE CONGRESS THOUGH COMPENSATED FOR THE LOSS WITH SUPPORT FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES AND WON THE ELECTION
Tamil-0049-9746	MSMAYAWATI HOWEVER FELT COMPELLED TO QUICKLY OFFER SUPPORT TO THE CONGRESS WHICH WAS SHORT ON NUMBERS IN MP
Tamil-0049-9747	AND RAJASTHAN CITING THE NEED TO KEEP THE BJP OUT
Tamil-0049-9748	LAST MONTH SHE TERMED THE BJP AND THE CONGRESS AS HAVING THE SAME CHARACTER
Tamil-0049-9749	AT THE HEART OF HER POLITICAL PROJECTION IS HER BATTLE TO WIN BACK A LARGER SPECTRUM OF DALIT SUPPORT
Tamil-0049-9750	WHILE HER CORE JATAV BASE IS LARGELY INTACT THE STRAIN OF AMBEDKARITE POLITICS SHE INHERITED FROM MENTOR KANSHI RAM IS BEING CHALLENGED IN THE OVERALL CHURN
Tamil-0049-9751	THE HINDUTVA UPSURGE UNDER NARENDRA MODI APPEALS TO A SECTION OF DALITS WHILE THE EMERGENCE OF NEW OUTFITS AND LEADERS SUCH AS CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD IN UP
Tamil-0049-9752	AND JIGNESH MEVANI IN GUJARAT INDICATES A YEARNING FOR ASSERTION AMONG SECTIONS OF DALITS
Tamil-0049-9753	THE CONGRESSS EFFORTS TO WOO DALITS ARE ALSO DISCOMFITING FOR HER
Tamil-0049-9754	MSMAYAWATIS SUCCESS IN GAINING POWER IN UP
Tamil-0049-9755	ON EARLIER OCCASIONS DEPENDED ON STITCHING ALLIANCES WITH BACKWARD CASTES AND UPPER CASTES EITHER THROUGH TIEUPS WITH THE SP OR THE BJP OR BY CREATING AN EQUIVALENT SOCIAL COALITION UNDER THE BSP BANNER
Tamil-0049-9756	AFTER THE GREAT DEBACLE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE BSP DID NOT GET EVEN ONE LOK SABHA SEAT SHE IS ANXIOUS THAT HER PRIMACY AS A DALIT LEADER IS SECURED
Tamil-0049-9757	THIS MORE THAN A CONTINUING ASPIRATION FOR THE PMS POST EXPLAINS HER EVASIVE POLITICS
Tamil-0049-9758	INDIA AND THE MALDIVES APPEARED TO RETURN TO THE OLD DAYS OF STRATEGIC BONHOMIE WHEN EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER SUSHMA SWARAJ MET HER COUNTERPART ABDULLA SHAHID IN MALE DURING A BRIEF VISIT THIS WEEK
Tamil-0049-9759	IT IS THE FIRST FULLFLEDGED BILATERAL VISIT AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL FROM INDIA TO THE MALDIVES AFTER THE NEW GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE IN THE WAKE OF THE HISTORIC ELECTION LAST SEPTEMBER
Tamil-0049-9760	PRESIDENT IBRAHIM SOLIH ASSUMED CHARGE AFTER A MULTIPARTY PRODEMOCRACY COALITION LED BY HIS MALDIVIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS SWEPT TO POWER
Tamil-0049-9761	MRSOLIHS INAUGURATION WHICH WAS MARKED BY THE ATTENDANCE OF PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI WAS ASSUMED TO BE A POTENTIAL INFLECTION POINT IN THE TRAJECTORY OF BILATERAL TIES WITH INDIA
Tamil-0049-9762	THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS WITNESSED MALES DISCONCERTING DRIFT UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE ABDULLA YAMEEN GOVERNMENT INTO WHAT MANY MALDIVIANS FELT WAS THE STIFLING EMBRACE OF CHINA
Tamil-0049-9763	CHINESE FINANCING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS POURED IN EVEN AS THE FUNCTIONING OF THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND THE JUDICIARY WAS HARSHLY CURTAILED
Tamil-0049-9764	ALL OF THIS FLUX APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN WASHED AWAY ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE MALDIVIAN ELECTORATE VOTED RESOUNDINGLY FOR THE COALITION THAT BACKED MRSOLIH FOR PRESIDENT
Tamil-0049-9765	YET IT WOULD BE UNWISE FOR NEW DELHI TO TAKE THE INDIAN OCEAN NATION FOR GRANTED
Tamil-0049-9766	THERE IS INDEED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RESET ON NUMEROUS POLICIES AND SOME OF THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED
Tamil-0049-9767	IN DECEMBER WHEN MRSOLIH VISITED INDIA A DOLLAR ONE BILLION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PACKAGE FOR THE MALDIVES WAS ANNOUNCED
Tamil-0049-9768	WHILE THE PROXIMITY OF THE INDIAN GENERAL ELECTION MAY HAVE PRECLUDED ANY MAJOR POLICY ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM NEW DELHI THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE AGREED TO EXEMPT HOLDERS OF DIPLOMATIC AND OFFICIAL PASSPORTS FROM VISA REQUIREMENTS INKED AN MOU ON INDIAN GRANTINAID FOR HIGHIMPACT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AREAS CRITICAL TO THE AGENDA OF MRSOLIH
Tamil-0049-9769	I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IN THE INTRO THAT SOME OF THESE ATTITUDES CAN ACTUALLY BRING POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
Tamil-0049-9770	NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIME PEOPLE JUST WONT USE THOSE MENTAL ATTITUDES FOR THEIR ADVANTAGES UNFORTUNATELY 
Tamil-0049-9771	WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IMPATIENCE CAN BE JUST AS GOOD A MINDSET AS PATIENCE CAN BE
Tamil-0049-9772	WHEN YOURE NATURALLY IMPATIENT YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET THINGS DONE FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYBODY ELSE WOULD
Tamil-0049-9773	THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT WITHOUT SELFCONTROL WE CAN OFTEN THEN TURN THIS INTO A HUGE DISADVANTAGE FOR OURSELVES BECAUSE WE SKIMP ON QUALITY JUST TO TICK THINGS OFF AS BEING COMPLETE
Tamil-0049-9774	THE OTHER DOWNSIDE OF IMPATIENCE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS QUALITY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO GO FLAT OUT AT WORK FOR THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO AND THEN GIVE UP ON THE THIRD
Tamil-0049-9775	CAN YOU RELATE TO THIS SO CAN I THATS WHY IMPATIENCE NEEDS TO BE KEPT AN EYE ON

Tamil-0050-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0050-9776	AT A BROADER LEVEL THE ARCHIPELAGO AND THE LARGER INDIAN OCEAN REGION COULD EXPECT MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES ON REGIONAL MARITIME SECURITY ISSUES INCLUDING COUNTERTERRORISM AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIMES
Tamil-0050-9777	HOWEVER MALE IS STILL GRAPPLING WITH THE LEGACY OF THE YAMEEN ADMINISTRATIONS HEADLONG PLUNGE INTO THE ORBIT OF BEIJING
Tamil-0050-9778	THE MASSIVE DEBTS THE MALDIVES INCURRED BY SOME ESTIMATES TO THE TUNE OF DOLLAR THREE BILLION LINKED TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE UNWOUND
Tamil-0050-9779	SECOND THE MULTIPARTY ALLIANCE MUST HOLD FIRM DESPITE IMMENSE POLITICAL PRESSURES THAT ARISE FROM VARYING VISIONS FOR GOVERNANCE
Tamil-0050-9780	SOME TENSIONS ALREADY SEEM TO BE BUBBLING TO THE TOP ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIVE MOHAMED NASHEED FORMER PRESIDENT AND IMPORTANT COALITIONBUILDER IN THE MDP TWEETED ABOUT THE COUNTRYS SUPREME COURT MEDDLING IN ELECTIONS  AGAIN
Tamil-0050-9781	FOR GENUINE PEACE AND BILATERAL HARMONY TO TAKE ROOT IN THE REGION BUILDING A SHARED VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE MALDIVES IS THE IMMEDIATE TASK AT HAND
Tamil-0050-9782	THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIAS DECISION LAST WEEK TO RESORT TO A DOLLARRUPEE SWAP INSTEAD OF THE TRADITIONAL OPENMARKET PURCHASE OF BONDS TO INFUSE LIQUIDITY INTO THE ECONOMY MARKS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN THE CENTRAL BANKS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT POLICY
Tamil-0050-9783	UNDER THE THREEYEAR CURRENCY SWAP SCHEME WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN ON TUESDAY NEXT WEEK THE RBI WILL PURCHASE DOLLAR FIVE BILLION FROM BANKS IN EXCHANGE FOR RUPEES
Tamil-0050-9784	THE CENTRAL BANK WILL INFUSE AS MUCH AS RUPEES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CRORE INTO THE SYSTEM IN ONE SHOT AT A TIME WHEN LIQUIDITY GENERALLY TENDS TO BE SQUEEZED
Tamil-0050-9785	FOR THE BANKS IT IS A WAY TO EARN SOME INTEREST OUT OF THE FOREX RESERVES LYING IDLE IN THEIR KITTY
Tamil-0050-9786	APART FROM INJECTING FRESH LIQUIDITY INTO THE ECONOMY THE MOVE WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CURRENCY MARKET EVEN AS IT HELPS SHORE UP THE RBIS DOLLAR RESERVES
Tamil-0050-9787	BOND YIELDS ROSE ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SWAP SCHEME LAST WEEK REFLECTING THE PREVAILING OPINION AMONG TRADERS THAT THE RBI MAY GRADUALLY REDUCE ITS DEPENDENCE ON THE REGULAR BOND PURCHASE SCHEME TO MANAGE LIQUIDITY WITHIN THE ECONOMY
Tamil-0050-9788	WHILE TRADITIONAL OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS DISTORT THE BOND MARKET THE NEW FOREX SWAP SCHEME WILL INTRODUCE NEW DISTORTIONS IN THE CURRENCY MARKET
Tamil-0050-9789	THE RUPEES RECENT RALLY AGAINST THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN HALTED BY THE RBIS DECISION TO INFUSE RUPEES AND SUCK OUT DOLLARS THROUGH THE SWAP SCHEME
Tamil-0050-9790	EVEN SO IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE RUPEE HAS APPRECIATED SIGNIFICANTLY IN VALUE TERMS AGAINST THE DOLLAR SINCE THE LOW REACHED IN OCTOBER AS FOREIGN INVESTORS HAVE BEGUN TO POUR MONEY INTO THE INDIAN ECONOMY
Tamil-0050-9791	OVERALL THE DOLLARRUPEE SWAP IS A USEFUL ADDITION TO THE RBIS POLICY TOOLKIT AS IT OFFERS THE CENTRAL BANK A CHANCE TO DIRECTLY INFLUENCE BOTH THE VALUE OF THE RUPEE AND THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY IN THE ECONOMY AT THE SAME TIME USING A SINGLE TOOL
Tamil-0050-9792	IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE LIQUIDITY CRISIS IN THE NONBANKING FINANCIAL SECTOR IT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO LOWER PRIVATE BORROWING COSTS AS WELL
Tamil-0050-9793	THE COMING ELECTIONS WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN CASH WITHDRAWALS FROM BANKS MAY HAVE ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN THE RBIS LARGER DECISION TO BOOST LIQUIDITY IN THE SYSTEM
Tamil-0050-9794	THE WAY BANKS RESPOND AFTER RECEIVING FRESH LIQUIDITY FROM THE RBI HOWEVER WILL DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW LIQUIDITY SCHEME TO A LARGE EXTENT
Tamil-0050-9795	BUSINESSES COULD BENEFIT FROM THE GREATER AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY BUT ONLY IF BANKS AGGRESSIVELY PASS ON THE BENEFIT OF LOWER RATES TO THEIR BORROWERS
Tamil-0050-9796	IF BANKS CHOOSE TO DEPOSIT THE FRESH RBI MONEY IN SAFE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AT LOW YIELDS AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST THE DE FACTO CAP ON THE GOVERNMENTS BORROWING COSTS WILL REMAIN INTACT
Tamil-0050-9797	BUT IF BANKS MANAGE TO FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO DEPLOY THEIR MONEY THE RBIS NEW LIQUIDITY SCHEME COULD END UP RAISING BORROWING COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT PUNISHING IT FOR FISCAL INDISCRETION
Tamil-0050-9798	WHEN PRAMOD SAWANT TOOK OFFICE DRAMATICALLY IN THE EARLY HOURS OF TUESDAY AS CHIEF MINISTER IT WAS THE TWENTY THIRD TIME THAT THE REGIME IN GOA CHANGED SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE EXCLUDING FIVE SPELLS OF PRESIDENTS RULE
Tamil-0050-9799	MRSAWANTS LEGISLATIVE MAJORITY IS FAR FROM CLEAR AND THE LONGEVITY OF HIS GOVERNMENT REMAINS A SUBJECT OF SPECULATION
Tamil-0050-9800	THE STATE VOTED A HUNG ASSEMBLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE BJP WINNING FEWER SEATS THAN THE CONGRESS
Tamil-0050-9801	I MENTIONED IMPATIENCE AS BEING BOTH A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE TOWARDS SUCCESS AND IN MANY WAYS STUBBORNNESS IS VERY SIMILAR 
Tamil-0050-9802	STARTING WITH THE LESS FOCUSED ON YET POSITIVE ATTITUDE STUBBORNNESS MEANS PEOPLE ARE HARDER TO CRACK WHEN OTHERS TRY TO TELL THEM THINGS CANT BE DONE 
Tamil-0050-9803	THEY WONT HAVE ANY OF IT
Tamil-0050-9804	IF YOURE A STUBBORN PERSON AS I CAN DEFINITELY BE AT TIMES THEN YOULL KNOW THAT ONCE YOURE SET ON DOING SOMETHING YOULL DO IT 
Tamil-0050-9805	IT DOESNT MATTER WHO TELLS YOU ITS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT CANT BE DONE YOU STILL BELIEVE IT CAN BE
Tamil-0050-9806	THE DOWNSIDE BEING THAT STUBBORN PEOPLE ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO TAKE OTHERS ADVICE OR EVEN WANT OTHER PEOPLES HELP 
Tamil-0050-9807	IT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAVE PEOPLE NARROW MINDED AND UNABLE TO SEE PAST WHAT THEY MAY BE FOCUSING ON WHICH IN ITSELF CAN BE BOTH AN ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE
Tamil-0050-9808	IT PERHAPS GIVES PEOPLE GREATER FOCUS BUT LESS VISIBILITY ON ANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY PRESENT THEMSELVES

Tamil-0051-9809	THE MACHINATIONS THAT LED TO THE INSTALLATION OF A BJPLED GOVERNMENT HEADED BY MANOHAR PARRIKAR DID NOT MATCH UP TO ANY HIGH STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0051-9810	PARRIKARS IMAGE ACTED AS A VENEER FOR HIS PARTYS LESS THAN HONOURABLE PURSUIT OF POWER
Tamil-0051-9811	HE WAS A MODERATE IN THE HINDUTVA PARTY AND REACHED OUT TO CHRISTIANS WHO CONSTITUTE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION
Tamil-0051-9812	HIS RETURN TO THE STATE AFTER LEAVING THE UNION CABINET WAS A CONDITION SET BY PARTIES AND INDEPENDENTS FOR SUPPORTING THE BJP
Tamil-0051-9813	HE WAS ABLE TO CONSIDERABLY INSULATE HIMSELF FROM THE AFFLICTIONS OF GOAS POLITICS
Tamil-0051-9814	WITH HIS PASSING POLITICS IN GOA COULD BE LESS RESTRAINED
Tamil-0051-9815	ITS POLITICIANS SHOULD STRIVE HARD TO PROVE THE SCEPTICS WRONG
Tamil-0051-9816	HISTORY OF COURSE DOES NOT COUNSEL OPTIMISM
Tamil-0051-9817	MULTIPLE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE VOLATILITY
Tamil-0051-9818	GOAS POPULATION AS PER CENSUS TWENTY ELEVEN IS JUST FOURTEEN LAKH AND IT IS ONE OF THE SMALLEST STATES ALSO IN TERMS OF AREA
Tamil-0051-9819	THERE ARE FOURTY ASSEMBLY CONSTITUENCIES RELATIVELY SMALL IN SIZE MOST HAVE LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND VOTERS
Tamil-0051-9820	BESIDES THE CONGRESS AND THE BJP THE MAHARASHTRAWADI GOMANTAK PARTY THE GOA FORWARD PARTY AND THE NATIONALIST CONGRESS PARTY ARE REPRESENTED IN THE CURRENT ASSEMBLY
Tamil-0051-9821	THE MAIN POLITICAL CONTEST IS BETWEEN THE BJP AND THE CONGRESS BUT GIVEN THE SMALL SIZES OF CONSTITUENCIES AND THE CLOSE CONTESTS THE SCOPE FOR MANIPULATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS VERY HIGH
Tamil-0051-9822	SEASONED POLITICAL PLAYERS HAVE PERFECTED THE ART OF SETTING UP MULTICORNERED CONTESTS BY FIELDING INDEPENDENTS AND FRINGE POLITICAL OUTFITS THAT FRAGMENT THE VOTES AND TURN THE TIDE TO THEIR BENEFIT
Tamil-0051-9823	GOA IS THE PLACE WHERE THE MANY ILLS OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY PLAY OUT IN A STARK MANNER
Tamil-0051-9824	LAND IS SCARCE WITH TOURISM BEING THE MAINSTAY OF THE ECONOMY
Tamil-0051-9825	MINING WHICH USED TO BE THE OTHER MAJOR DRIVER OF THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN STALLED BY THE SUPREME COURT SINCE FEBRUARY LAST YEAR
Tamil-0051-9826	THERE ARE NUMEROUS AVENUES FOR POLITICAL PATRONAGE RENTSEEKING AND GENERATION OF DIRTY MONEY
Tamil-0051-9827	THE POLITICAL SYSTEM RATHER THAN ACTING AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE HAZARDOUS FORCES THAT ITS ECONOMY AND GEOGRAPHY GENERATE OFTEN ENDS UP ACCELERATING THEM
Tamil-0051-9828	A GOVERNMENT WITH A WAFERTHIN MAJORITY IS UNLIKELY TO ADDRESS THESE SYSTEMIC ILLS
Tamil-0051-9829	WITH THE OVERWHELMING VOTE ON THURSDAY TO SEEK A DELAY TO THE EXIT FROM THE EU BRITAINS PARLIAMENT MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY ANOTHER CHANCE TO PUSH HER EXISTING DEAL FOR BREXIT
Tamil-0051-9830	A DAY EARLIER A MAJORITY OF THE MPS DECIDED TO RULE OUT UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BRITAINS CRASHING OUT OF THE EU WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT
Tamil-0051-9831	WITH THE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF A HARD BREXIT OPTION THUS FORECLOSED FROM BRITAINS PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST THERE IS GOOD REASON TO THINK THAT THE WORST IS OVER FOR THE UK ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO CLUE YET TO THE DIRECTION OF THE EXIT
Tamil-0051-9832	BOTH THESE PROPOSALS HAD BEEN REJECTED AS PART OF EARLIER AMENDMENTS TO THE DRAFT WITHDRAWAL BILL AND THE VOTES THIS WEEK REFLECT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN PARLIAMENTS STANCE
Tamil-0051-9833	YET A DELAY TO THE MARCH TWENTY NINE DEADLINE TO LEAVE THE EU CAN ONLY BRING A TEMPORARY RESPITE FROM UNCERTAINTY
Tamil-0051-9834	YOULL NOTICE THAT UP UNTIL NOW NONE OF THE ATTITUDES LISTED REALLY SERVE AS A MENTAL BLOCK FOR PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE OR NOT WANTING TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF SUCCESS
Tamil-0051-9835	THATS WHERE DISBELIEF COMES IN WHAT WITH ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BECOMING ABNORMALLY SUCCESSFUL AND A LARGE PERCENTAGE THAT PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT AND STILL DONT MAKE IT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT
Tamil-0051-9836	THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAME FROM BACKGROUNDS WHERE MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT COULD NEVER BE DONE UNTIL THEY HAD THE BELIEVE TO FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES
Tamil-0051-9837	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE COMING FROM A SMALL VILLAGE IN AUSTRIA BECOMING A WORLD CHAMPION BODYBUILDER WAS ALMOST DEEMED OUT OF THE QUESTION

Tamil-0053-9876	HOWEVER THE LIBERATION OF BAGHOUZ OR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TERRITORIAL CALIPHATE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE IS HAS BEEN DEFEATED
Tamil-0053-9877	IT IS BASICALLY AN INSURGENTJIHADIST GROUP
Tamil-0053-9878	IT HAS ESTABLISHED CELLS ESPECIALLY IN SYRIA AND IRAQ WHICH HAVE CONTINUED TO CARRY OUT TERROR ATTACKS EVEN AS IS TERRITORIES KEPT SHRINKING

Tamil-0053-9883	THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOAN IS WARY OF THE RAPID RISE OF THE SYRIAN KURDS WHO ARE ORGANISATIONALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY ALIGNED WITH KURDISH REBELS ON THE TURKISH SIDE

Tamil-0053-9905	STILL SOMETIMES FRIENDS WOULD BECOME PARTNERS IN CRIME WHEN IT CAME TO INDULGING TOGETHER
Tamil-0053-9906	FRIENDS HELP BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOU THERES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT

Tamil-0057-0021	PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI DESCRIBED HIM AS AN OUTSTANDING STATESMAN OF OUR TIMES
Tamil-0057-0022	WHILE MRMUKHERJEES SENIORITY AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE POLITY ARE NOT IN DOUBT THE FACT THAT HE AGREED TO SPEAK AT AN RSS EVENT LAST YEAR TO THE BEMUSED DISAPPROVAL OF THE CONGRESS PARTY WAS HELD OUT AS A REASON
Tamil-0057-0023	AND MORE UNSYMPATHETICALLY COULD THE AWARD HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE BJPS STRATEGY OF EMBRACING OLD CONGRESS LEADERS SUCH AS VALLABHBHAI PATEL TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ITS REAL OPPOSITION IS TO THE NEHRUGANDHI FAMILY IT IS NO SECRET THAT MRMUKHERJEES POLITICAL AMBITIONS WERE THWARTED AT ONE POINT BY HIS INABILITY TO BREAK THE HOLD OF DYNASTIC POLITICS IN THE CONGRESS
Tamil-0057-0024	WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE DESERVES A PARTICULAR HONOUR IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO RESOLVE
Tamil-0057-0025	IDOLISED LEADERS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE IMAGINATION OF A COMMUNITY AND ARGUABLY FOR NATIONBUILDING
Tamil-0057-0026	SUCH SECULAR RITES OF VENERATION SET AN IDEAL THAT THE COMMUNITY CELEBRATES AND STRIVES FOR
Tamil-0057-0027	THIS IS OF COURSE DIFFERENT FROM THE PURSUIT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL INTERESTS
Tamil-0057-0028	UNFORTUNATELY COMPETITIVE POLITICS HAS OVERSHADOWED THE MAJESTY OF THE BHARAT RATNA
Tamil-0057-0029	THE HONOUR TO MGRAMACHANDRAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WAS WIDELY SEEN AS A CYNICAL POLITICAL MOVE AHEAD OF AN ELECTION IN TAMIL NADU
Tamil-0057-0030	A PROMISE TO CONFER THE BHARAT RATNA TO MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA WAS MADE BY MRMODI DURING THE TWENTY FOURTEEN CAMPAIGN AND HE FULFILLED IT SOON AFTER COMING TO POWER
Tamil-0057-0031	CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS FOR THE HONOUR HAVE BECOME PART OF ASSERTIONS OF POWER BY VARIOUS GROUPS
Tamil-0057-0032	THE EMERGENCE OF NEW POLITICAL ELITES IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY A CLAMOUR FOR GREATER ACCEPTANCE FOR THEIR LEADERS IN THE NATIONAL ROLL OF HONOUR
Tamil-0057-0033	A DEMOCRATIC PLURAL COMMUNITY MUST RESOLVE THESE DEMANDS WITH RESPECT AND SENSITIVITY
Tamil-0057-0034	BUT THIS MUST NOT LEAD TO A DEVALUATION OF THE HONOUR
Tamil-0057-0035	TRANSPARENCY IS NOT EASY TO ACHIEVE AND FAIRNESS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH GIVEN THE CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS OF REPRESENTATION AND MAJESTY
Tamil-0057-0036	BUT A GOOD PLACE TO START IS TO DISCONTINUE POSTHUMOUS AWARDS
Tamil-0057-0037	IT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE OF ARBITRARINESS
Tamil-0057-0038	IDOLS AND IDEALS UNITE DIVERSITIES IN A COMMUNITY AND BHARAT RATNAS MUST BE SELECTED WITH THIS IN MIND
Tamil-0057-0039	ON THIS COUNT AT LEAST THE MODI GOVERNMENTS LIST WILL BE CONTESTED
Tamil-0057-0040	IN APPOINTING HIS SISTER PRIYANKA GANDHI VADRA AS A GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE PARTY CONGRESS PRESIDENT RAHUL GANDHI PROBABLY CALCULATED THAT THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGHED THE RISKS
Tamil-0057-0041	WHILE THE BJP LOST NO TIME IN DECRYING THE MOVE AS ANOTHER INSTANCE OF DYNASTIC POLITICS THE HIGHSTAKES MANOEUVRE COULD LIFT THE PROFILE OF THE CONGRESS AS A SERIOUS CONTENDER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION
Tamil-0057-0042	IN UTTAR PRADESH WHERE IT HAS BEEN LEFT HIGH AND DRY IN THE SEATSHARING DEAL BETWEEN THE SAMAJWADI PARTY AND THE BAHUJAN SAMAJ PARTY IT SORELY NEEDS A DRAMATIC TURNAROUND IN POLITICAL FORTUNES
Tamil-0057-0043	WHILE HER FORMAL INDUCTION INTO POLITICS MAY HAVE BEEN PROMPTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE ILLHEALTH OF HER MOTHER FORMER CONGRESS PRESIDENT SONIA GANDHI THE CHARGE OF EASTERN UTTAR PRADESH WAS SURELY MEANT AS A SIGNAL TO THE SP AND THE BSP
Tamil-0057-0044	ALTHOUGH HER ONLY PREVIOUS FORMAL ROLE IN POLITICS WAS AS THE PARTYS CAMPAIGN MANAGER IN AMETHI AND RAE BARELI CONSTITUENCIES OF HER BROTHER AND MOTHER MSVADRA IS HIGH ON CHARISMA QUOTIENT THAT INTANGIBLE BUT NONETHELESS REAL QUALITY THAT SAW CROWDS GATHER IN THE PARTYS POCKET BOROUGHS

Tamil-0057-0053	THATS WHY YOU SHOULD BE WISE TO CHOOSE FRIENDS WHO GENUINELY CARE ABOUT YOU 
Tamil-0057-0054	IF YOU FEEL GOOD AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF MEETING THEM ITS A SIGN THEY COULD BE ONE OF THESE FRIENDS WHO BOOST YOUR LONGEVITY

Tamil-0059-0004	SHE HAD YOUR DARK SUIT IN GREASY WASH WATER ALL YEAR 
Tamil-0059-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0059-0088	WHAT IS BEYOND DOUBT IS THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT DOING THEIR DUTY BY INDIAS CHILDREN
Tamil-0059-0089	INDIA WON GLOBAL ACCLAIM FOR ITS BEAT PLASTIC POLLUTION RESOLVE DECLARED ON WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY LAST YEAR UNDER WHICH IT PLEDGED TO ELIMINATE SINGLEUSE PLASTIC BY TWENTY TWENTYTWO
Tamil-0059-0090	SO FAR TWENTY TWO STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES HAVE JOINED THE FIGHT ANNOUNCING A BAN ON SINGLEUSE PLASTICS SUCH AS CARRY BAGS CUPS PLATES CUTLERY STRAWS AND THERMOCOL PRODUCTS
Tamil-0059-0091	PUDUCHERRY WILL IMPLEMENT A BAN FROM MARCH ONE 
Tamil-0059-0092	WHERE FIRM ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN POSITIVE RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED
Tamil-0059-0093	A BENGALURU WASTE COLLECTIVE ESTIMATES THAT THE VOLUME OF PLASTIC WASTE THAT THEY COLLECT DROPPED FROM ABOUT TWO TONNES A DAY TO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED KG
Tamil-0059-0094	VOLUNTARY INITIATIVES ARE HAVING AN IMPACT IN MANY STATES AS CITIZENS REDUCE REUSE AND SORT THEIR WASTE
Tamil-0059-0095	YET THIS IS ONLY A SMALL START
Tamil-0059-0096	WASTE PLASTIC FROM PACKAGING OF EVERYTHING FROM FOOD COSMETICS AND GROCERIES TO GOODS DELIVERED BY ONLINE PLATFORMS REMAINS UNADDRESSED
Tamil-0059-0097	IT WILL TAKE A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WASTE IS COLLECTED AND HANDLED BY MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES TO CHANGE THIS
Tamil-0059-0098	GOVERNMENTS MUST START CHARGING THE PRODUCERS FOR THEIR WASTE AND COLLECT IT DILIGENTLY WHICH WILL LEAD TO RECOVERY AND RECYCLING
Tamil-0059-0099	BUT THE DEPRESSING REALITY IS THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE UNWILLING TO UPGRADE THEIR WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WHICH IS NECESSARY TO EVEN MEASURE THE TRUE SCALE OF PACKAGING WASTE
Tamil-0059-0100	THE PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT RULES TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE CLEAR THAT PRODUCERS IMPORTERS AND BRAND OWNERS MUST ADOPT A COLLECTBACK SYSTEM FOR THE PLASTIC THEY INTRODUCE INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
Tamil-0059-0101	ALTHOUGH THE RULES WERE NOTIFIED IN THE SAME YEAR AMENDED LATER AND GIVEN HIGH VISIBILITY BY THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE NOT MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TO TAKE THE PROCESS FORWARD
Tamil-0059-0102	AT THE VERY LEAST LOCAL BODIES SHOULD CONSULT MANUFACTURERS OR IMPORTERS TO ASSESS THE PROBLEM
Tamil-0059-0103	DELAYING SUCH A MEASURE HAS CREATED THE ANOMALOUS SITUATION OF SMALL PRODUCERS OF PLASTICS FACING THE BAN WHILE MORE ORGANISED ENTITIES COVERED BY THE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY CLAUSE CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL
Tamil-0059-0104	SUCH ENFORCEMENT FAILURE IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF RELAXING THE PROHIBITION ON FLIMSY PLASTICS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR UNDER FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT TO RECOVER THOUSANDS OF TONNES OF WASTE THAT END UP IN DUMPING SITES
Tamil-0059-0105	CITIES AND TOWNS NEED COMPETENT MUNICIPAL SYSTEMS TO ACHIEVE THIS
Tamil-0059-0106	AGAIN THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT PLASTICS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN SEVERAL INDUSTRIES NOTABLY IN THE AUTOMOTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL HEALTH CARE AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS
Tamil-0059-0107	BUT IT IS THE FAST MOVING CONSUMER GOODS SECTOR THAT USES LARGE VOLUMES OF PACKAGING POSING A HIGHER ORDER CHALLENGE
Tamil-0059-0108	THIS CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION
Tamil-0059-0109	GOVERNMENTS SHOULD SHOW THE SAME RESOLVE HERE AS THEY HAVE DONE IN IMPOSING THE BAN
Tamil-0059-0110	THE SLAPPING OF SEDITION CHARGES AGAINST NOTED ASSAMESE SCHOLAR HIREN GOHAIN AND TWO OTHERS FOR REMARKS MADE AGAINST THE PROPOSED CITIZENSHIP LAW IS A TEXTBOOK CASE OF MISUSE OF THE LAW RELATING TO SEDITION
Tamil-0059-0111	THE FIR AGAINST MRGOHAIN PEASANT RIGHTS ACTIVIST AKHIL GOGOI AND JOURNALIST MANJIT MAHANTA RELATES TO SPEECHES AT A RECENT RALLY THAT ALLUDED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEMAND FOR INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY IF THE CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL WAS PUSHED THROUGH PARLIAMENT
Tamil-0059-0112	MRGOHAIN AND OTHERS HAVE OBTAINED INTERIM BAIL FROM THE GAUHATI HIGH COURT
Tamil-0059-0113	THE FIRST STEP TO BUILDING ANY KIND OF CONNECTION WITH SOMEONE IS BY HAVING SOMETHING TO OFFER 
Tamil-0059-0114	THATS THE ONLY REASON WHY PEOPLE NATURALLY BECOME FRIENDS WITH EACH OTHER
Tamil-0059-0115	IT DOESNT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ABOUT INFLUENCE 
Tamil-0059-0116	A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT BECAUSE THEY DONT YET HAVE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MONEY OR POWERFUL CONNECTIONS THEY CANT CONNECT WITH THOSE THAT DO
Tamil-0059-0117	THIS ISNT TRUE
Tamil-0059-0118	VALUE COMES IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS
Tamil-0059-0119	YOUR PERSONALITY YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY ARE ALL FORMS OF VALUE 
Tamil-0059-0120	WHEN PEOPLE CHOOSE OTHERS TO BE AROUND THEY PSYCHOLOGICALLY BOND WITH SOMEONE BASED ON CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES 
Tamil-0059-0121	MAYBE YOURE FUNNY TRUSTWORTHY POSITIVE AND SUPPORTIVE READ A LOT OF BOOKS WHO KNOWS
Tamil-0059-0122	THE POINT BEING THAT IF YOU ARE TO CONNECT WITH INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE YOU FIRST NEED TO FIND SOME SORT OF COMMON GROUND 
Tamil-0059-0123	ONCE YOURE ABLE TO DO THAT YOULL KNOW HOW TO GIVE VALUE TO PEOPLE AND GET IT BACK IN RETURN

Tamil-0060-0005	DONT ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT
Tamil-0060-0124	THE REGISTRATION OF THE CASE HAS CAUSED MUCH PUBLIC OUTRAGE IN ASSAM
Tamil-0060-0125	IN ADDITION TO SECTION ONE TWENTY FOUR A SEDITION THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ENTERING INTO A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SECTION ONE TWENTY ONE AND CONCEALING A DESIGN TO FACILITATE SUCH A WAR SECTION ONE TWENTY THREE 
Tamil-0060-0126	THE ACTION OF THE POLICE IN CHARGING THEM WITH OFFENCES AGAINST THE STATE UNDER THE INDIAN PENAL CODE IS QUITE REPREHENSIBLE
Tamil-0060-0127	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SPEECHES AT THE RALLY ORGANISED BY THE FORUM AGAINST THE CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT BILL CONTAINED STRIDENT OPPOSITION TO THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT WOULD ALLOW PERSECUTED NONMUSLIMS FROM THREE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES TO OBTAIN INDIAN CITIZENSHIP
Tamil-0060-0128	THE THRUST OF THE PROTEST THEREFORE WOULD BE SQUARELY COVERED BY THE EXCEPTION TO THE SEDITION CLAUSE WHICH SAYS COMMENTS EXPRESSING DISAPPROBATION OF GOVERNMENT MEASURES WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING THEIR ALTERATION DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFENCE AS LONG AS THERE IS NO INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE OR DISAFFECTION
Tamil-0060-0129	MRGOHAIN A SAHITYA AKADEMI AWARDEE AND ONE OF ASSAMS BEST KNOWN PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS HAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD INTERVENED MORE THAN ONCE TO SILENCE SOME YOUTH WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT INVOKING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IF THE CENTRE CONTINUED TO IGNORE THEIR DEMAND
Tamil-0060-0130	IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INSTANCES OF STATE GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SILENCE POLITICAL DISSENT BY ACCUSING DISSENTERS OF PROMOTING DISAFFECTION
Tamil-0060-0131	IT IS PRECISELY TO PREVENT SUCH A HEAVYHANDED RESPONSE TO STRIDENT POLITICAL CRITICISM THAT COURTS HAVE OFTEN POINTED OUT THAT THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT OF ANY OFFENCE OF SEDITION IS AN IMMINENT THREAT TO PUBLIC ORDER
Tamil-0060-0132	UNLESS THERE IS ACTUAL INCITEMENT TO TAKE UP ARMS OR RESORT TO VIOLENCE EVEN DEMANDS THAT GO AGAINST THE LEGAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME OF THINGS WOULD NOT AMOUNT TO SEDITION
Tamil-0060-0133	MERE EXPRESSION OF CRITICAL VIEWS HOWSOEVER SCATHING CANNOT BE AN EXCUSE FOR ACCUSING SOMEONE OF PLANNING TO WAGE WAR OR PROMOTE DISAFFECTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT
Tamil-0060-0134	IT IS AGAINST SUCH A BACKDROP THAT THE LAW COMMISSION IN A CONSULTATION PAPER RELEASED LAST YEAR HAD CALLED FOR A RECONSIDERATION OF THE SEDITION SECTION IN THE IPC
Tamil-0060-0135	WHILE THE PROVISION WHICH IS COUCHED IN BROAD TERMS NEEDS A MUCH NARROWER DEFINITION THE RIGHT COURSE IS TO SCRAP SECTION ONE TWENTY FOUR A A RELIC OF THE COLONIAL ERA ALTOGETHER
Tamil-0060-0136	AFTER LAST MONTHS GENERAL ELECTION THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO DR CONGO IS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE FIRST EVER TRANSFER OF POWER VIA THE BALLOT SINCE GAINING INDEPENDENCE IN NINETEEN SIXTY
Tamil-0060-0137	PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA WHO HAD ALREADY DEFERRED THE POLLS BY TWO YEARS POSTPONED THEM AGAIN BY A WEEK DAYS BEFORE IT WAS SCHEDULED IN DECEMBER
Tamil-0060-0138	HE CITED THE EBOLA OUTBREAK IN SOME PROVINCES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES IN A FIRE IN THE CAPITAL KINSHASA AS REASONS FOR THE LATEST DELAY
Tamil-0060-0139	BUT MRKABILAS CRITICS DISMISSED THESE EXCUSES AS COMING FROM A PRESIDENT IN DENIAL OF HIS IMPENDING DEFEAT AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS IN POWER
Tamil-0060-0140	THEIR SUSPICIONS APPEARED TO BE JUSTIFIED AS PROMINENT OPPOSITION LEADERS WERE BARRED FROM THE CONTEST BY PARTISAN COURTS AND THE ELECTION COMMISSION
Tamil-0060-0141	MEANWHILE THE UN HAS VOICED CONCERNS OVER THE QUALITY OF VOTING MACHINES AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE STATE MACHINERY TO OBSTRUCT OPPOSITION CAMPAIGNS ADDING TO THE SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY

Tamil-0060-0143	WHEN THE ELECTION COMMISSION LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED FELIX TSHISEKEDI LEADER OF THE UNION FOR DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AS THE WINNER IT PREDICTABLY CREATED A CONTROVERSY
Tamil-0060-0144	MRKABILAS CANDIDATE FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER EMMANUEL SHADARY WAS EXPECTED TO ROMP HOME
Tamil-0060-0145	IN THE EVENT MRSHADARY WHO FACES ACCUSATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES WAS RANKED THIRD
Tamil-0060-0146	THE OUTCOME TRIGGERED INTENSE SPECULATION THAT MRKABILA HAD CUT A DEAL TO BACK MRTSHISEKEDI SON OF A DECEASED OPPOSITION LEADER

Tamil-0060-0156	FACEBOOK USED TO JUST BE A PLACE WHERE I COULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH MY FRIENDS 
Tamil-0060-0157	A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I EXPANDED TO CONNECTING WITH LIKEMINDED PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM
Tamil-0060-0158	NOWADAYS ALL I HAVE TO DO IS LOGIN AND IM FACED WITH AMAZING VIDEOS AND INSIGHTS BY OTHER PROFESSIONALS

Tamil-0062-9642	THAT IS NO SMALL COMFORT GOING BY THE GOVERNMENTS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE STEP BESIDES PROTECTING THE PEACE ACROSS IRELAND
Tamil-0062-9643	RAHUL GANDHIS DECISION TO CHOOSE WAYANAD IN KERALA IN ADDITION TO AMETHI IN UTTAR PRADESH TO CONTEST COULD WELL BE A DEFINING MOMENT IN THIS ELECTION
Tamil-0062-9644	THOUGH WAYANAD WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS THE DECISION WAS NONETHELESS SURPRISING AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT WOULD BE NOT HIS NATIONALLEVEL IDEOLOGICAL RIVAL THE BJP BUT A PARTY OF THE LEFT WHICH IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR A SECULAR ALTERNATIVE TO THE RULING FORMATION
Tamil-0062-9645	THIS PARADOX COULD TURN OUT TO BE A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN THE EMERGENCE OF A NATIONAL COALITION AGAINST THE BJP BECAUSE MANY PARTIES THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE BJP ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER
Tamil-0062-9646	MRGANDHIS GAMBIT AMPLIFIES THAT CONTRADICTION AND MARKS A RUPTURE BETWEEN THE CONGRESS AND THE LEFT FRONT  FIERCE OPPONENTS IN KERALA BUT NATURAL PARTNERS AT THE CENTRE
Tamil-0062-9647	THE NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE CONGRESS HAD KEPT AN ARMS LENGTH FROM THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE POLITICS IN KERALA WHERE ITS STATE UNIT AND THE LEFT ARE FACE TO FACE
Tamil-0062-9648	THE EXIGENCIES OF NATIONAL POLITICS SHAPE THEIR COOPERATION ELSEWHERE
Tamil-0062-9649	ONLY RECENTLY ON MRGANDHIS WATCH THE CONGRESS WAS IN SEATSHARING TALKS WITH THE LEFT IN WEST BENGAL
Tamil-0062-9650	THOUGH THE CONGRESS HAS SAID MRGANDHIS CANDIDATURE IS NOT AGAINST THE LEFT THE LATTER HAS BEEN BRUTAL IN ITS REACTION
Tamil-0062-9651	THE CONGRESS CLAIMED THE FORAY SIGNALLED MRGANDHIS COMMITMENT TO ALL REGIONS
Tamil-0062-9652	BUT THE CHOICE OF KERALA RATHER THAN KARNATAKA WHERE THE CONGRESS IS LOCKED IN A DIRECT BATTLE WITH THE BJP IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
Tamil-0062-9653	IF THE LEFT FRONTALLY ATTACKED THE CONGRESS THE BJP WAS DISPARAGING
Tamil-0062-9654	AMIT SHAH REMARKED MRGANDHI FEARED HE WOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY AMETHIS VOTERS AND NARENDRA MODI IN A STATEMENT WITH COMMUNAL OVERTONES SAID MRGANDHI CHOSE THE SEAT BECAUSE HINDUS WERE IN A MINORITY THERE
Tamil-0062-9655	BY FIELDING MRGANDHI FROM WAYANAD THE CONGRESS HAS TAKEN A VIEW THAT CONSIDERATIONS OF ALLIANCES ARE NOW SECONDARY TO ITS PUSH TO MAXIMISE ITS INDIVIDUAL TALLY
Tamil-0062-9656	THE CONGRESS HAS STRONG ALLIANCES IN MAHARASHTRA TAMIL NADU AND BIHAR BUT A SHAKY ONE IN KARNATAKA
Tamil-0062-9657	ITS UP
Tamil-0062-9658	AMBITIONS WERE REJECTED BY THE SPBSP AXIS AND DIFFERENCES PERSIST WITHIN THE PARTY ON ALIGNING WITH THE AAP IN DELHI
Tamil-0062-9659	AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR ELECTIONS THE CONGRESS BECAME THE FULCRUM OF A NATIONAL COALITION WHICH WAS BOUND BY A BROAD COMMITMENT TO A PLURALIST INDIA AS OPPOSED TO HINDUTVAS EXCLUSIVIST AND MAJORITARIAN POLITICS
Tamil-0062-9660	THE LEFT HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ITS FORMATION BUT ENDED THE EXPERIMENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OVER DIFFERENCES WITH THE CONGRESS ON THE NUCLEAR DEAL
Tamil-0062-9661	STATELEVEL COMPULSIONS HAVE LED REGIONAL PARTIES TO CROSS FROM THE BJP TO THE CONGRESS AND VICE VERSA BUT THE PRIMARY FAULTLINE IS POLITICAL MOBILISATION ALONG RELIGIOUS LINES
Tamil-0062-9662	WITHOUT CLARITY OF CONCEPT ON ADDRESSING THIS FAULTLINE THERE CAN BE NO EFFECTIVE COOPERATION AMONG NONBJP PARTIES
Tamil-0062-9663	THOUGH IT IS UNFAIR TO PUT THE ENTIRE ONUS OF AGGREGATING NONBJP POLITICS ON MRGANDHI HIS CANDIDACY IN WAYANAD CAN DO NOTHING FOR THE LARGER SECULAR CAUSE
Tamil-0062-9664	THE DRAMA OF GOVERNMENTFORMATION AND CABINET SHUFFLE AMID SHIFTS IN POLITICAL ALLEGIANCE IN GOA SERVES AS A REMINDER OF THE DARK SHADOWS OF MANOEUVRE AND INTRIGUE THAT LURK WITHIN INDIAN DEMOCRACY
Tamil-0062-9665	GREED IS ONE OF THOSE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES PEOPLE HAVE NORMALLY AFTER THEY BECOME RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL
Tamil-0062-9666	THE MONEY AND POWER GOES TO THEIR HEAD WHICH EVENTUALLY LEADS TO THEM CHASING MORE OF IT AND COMPLETELY DISREGARDING THEIR ORIGINAL GOALS
Tamil-0062-9667	ITS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN BUSINESS AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY END UP DESTROYING THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF IT
Tamil-0062-9668	SURE YOU CAN NATURALLY BE GREEDY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
Tamil-0062-9669	THATS WHY YOULL SEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR START BUSINESSES WITH NOTHING BUT DOLLAR SIGNS IN THEIR EYES
Tamil-0062-9670	THEY WANT THE MONEY THEY WANT THE POWER BUT THEY HAVE NO PASSION FOR HELPING OTHERS 
Tamil-0062-9671	SO GREED IS DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE PEOPLE HAVE POTENTIALLY BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ACHIEVING SUCCESS IN THEIR LIVES
Tamil-0062-9672	THE FIRST TWO GOALS PEOPLE HAVE INVOLVE MONEY AND POWER WHATS YOUR THIRD GOAL FORGET THE FIRST TWO AND FOCUS ON THAT ONE

Tamil-0063-9395	HANDING OVER THE FINE AMOUNTS PAID BY THE ACCUSED AS PART OF THEIR SENTENCE IS ONE ASPECT OF SUCH JUSTICE ANOTHER ASPECT IS FOR THE COURT TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIM FROM ITS OWN COFFERS

Tamil-0063-9397	THE COURT NOTED THAT SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF WITNESSING HER DAUGHTER BEING SMASHED AGAINST A WALL AS WELL AS THE DEVASTATION SUFFERED BY HER FAMILY
Tamil-0063-9398	SHE WAS ALSO PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT
Tamil-0063-9399	FURTHER THE COURT WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS LEADING AN ITINERANT HANDTOMOUTH EXISTENCE
Tamil-0063-9400	IT IS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE BENCH HEADED BY CHIEF JUSTICE OF INDIA RANJAN GOGOI AWARDED HER RUPEES FIFTY LAKH BESIDES ASKING THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE HER WITH A GOVERNMENT JOB AND A HOUSE
Tamil-0063-9401	MSBANOS CASE IS INDEED A RARE ONE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RESULTED IN CONVICTION AND LIFE SENTENCES TO ELEVEN PERSONS
Tamil-0063-9402	THE SENTENCES WERE UPHELD BY THE BOMBAY HIGH COURT
Tamil-0063-9403	FURTHER THE COURT FOUND DELIBERATE INACTION ON THE PART OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS AND THAT THE AUTOPSIES WERE PERFUNCTORY AND MANIPULATED
Tamil-0063-9404	THE SUPREME COURT HAS ASKED FOR THE PENSION BENEFITS OF THREE POLICE OFFICERS TO BE WITHDRAWN
Tamil-0063-9405	IN SHORT THIS IS A CONCRETE INSTANCE OF STATE INACTION AND NEGLIGENCE THAT WOULD NORMALLY JUSTIFY THE PAYMENT OF A HEFTY COMPENSATION
Tamil-0063-9406	NOT EVERY CRIME WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
Tamil-0063-9407	WHILE CONVICTIONS ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY IN CASES OF MOB VIOLENCE VICTIM COMPENSATION MAY OFTEN BE THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE SOME JUSTICE
Tamil-0063-9408	THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE WAS AMENDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO INSERT SECTION THREE FIFTY SEVEN A UNDER WHICH EVERY STATE GOVERNMENT HAS TO PREPARE A SCHEME TO SET UP A FUND FROM WHICH COMPENSATION CAN BE PAID TO VICTIMS OF CRIME AND THEIR DEPENDANTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED LOSS AND INJURY AND WHO MAY REQUIRE REHABILITATION
Tamil-0063-9409	THE CENTRE HAS A CENTRAL VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
Tamil-0063-9410	ON SUPREME COURT DIRECTIONS THE NATIONAL LEGAL SERVICES AUTHORITY HAS PREPARED A COMPENSATION SCHEME FOR WOMEN VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND OTHER CRIMES
Tamil-0063-9411	MANY STATES HAVE NOTIFIED SCHEMES ON THESE LINES
Tamil-0063-9412	WHILE ON PAPER THERE IS A MECHANISM TO ASSESS REHABILITATION NEEDS AND PAY COMPENSATION THERE IS A NEED TO STREAMLINE THE SCHEMES AND ENSURE THAT THE COMPENSATION PROCESS IS NOT DONE IN AN AD HOC MANNER BUT IS BASED ON SOUND PRINCIPLES
Tamil-0063-9413	WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT SUNDAYS UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF IS THAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE SO PREDICTABLE

Telugu-0006-0244	TO DO THIS IS TO WORK UPON THE PLANE OF THE ABSOLUTE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE WE MUST ENDEAVOUR TO IMPRESS UPON OUR SUBJECTIVE MIND THE IDEA OF THAT WHICH WE DESIRE QUITE APART FROM ANY CONDITIONS 
Telugu-0006-0245	THIS SEPARATION FROM THE ELEMENTS OF CONDITION IMPLIES THE ELIMINATION OF THE IDEA OF TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY WE MUST THINK OF THE THING AS ALREADY IN ACTUAL EXISTENCE
Telugu-0006-0246	UNLESS WE DO THIS WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUSLY OPERATING UPON THE PLANE OF THE ABSOLUTE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT EMPLOYING THE CREATIVE POWER OF OUR THOUGHT 
Telugu-0006-0247	THE SIMPLEST PRACTICAL METHOD OF GAINING THE HABIT OF THINKING IN THIS MANNER IS TO CONCEIVE THE EXISTENCE IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD OF A SPIRITUAL PROTOTYPE OF EVERY EXISTING THING WHICH BECOMES THE ROOT OF THE CORRESPONDING EXTERNAL EXISTENCE

Telugu-0010-0411	ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH PERIOD 
Telugu-0010-0412	THE SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK THE CONTRACT WHICH WOULD HAVE RAISED PAY LEVELS BUT CUT BENEFITS 
Telugu-0010-0413	IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE INTUITION WORKS MOST READILY IN RESPECT TO THOSE SUBJECTS WHICH MOST HABITUALLY OCCUPY OUR THOUGHT 
Telugu-0010-0414	AND ACCORDING TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THIS MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE BY THE FORMATION OF BRAINCHANNELS SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR THE INDUCTION IN THE MOLECULAR SYSTEM OF VIBRATIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE PARTICULAR CLASS OF IDEAS IN QUESTION 
Telugu-0010-0415	BUT OF COURSE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE IDEAS THEMSELVES ARE NOT CAUSED BY THE MOLECULAR CHANGES BUT ON THE CONTRARY ARE THE CAUSE OF THEM 
Telugu-0010-0416	AND IT IS IN THIS TRANSLATION OF THOUGHT ACTION INTO PHYSICAL ACTION THAT WE ARE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE ETERNAL MYSTERY OF THE DESCENT OF SPIRIT INTO MATTER 
Telugu-0010-0417	AND THAT THOUGH WE MAY TRACE MATTER THROUGH SUCCESSIVE DEGREES OF REFINEMENT TILL IT BECOMES WHAT IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE DENSER MODES THAT ARE MOST FAMILIAR WE MIGHT CALL A SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE YET AT THE END OF IT IT IS NOT THE INTELLIGENT THINKING PRINCIPLE ITSELF 
Telugu-0010-0418	THE CRITERION IS IN THE WORD VIBRATIONS 
Telugu-0010-0419	HOWEVER DELICATELY ETHERIC THE SUBSTANCE ITS MOVEMENT COMMENCES BY THE VIBRATION OF ITS PARTICLES AND A VIBRATION IS A WAVE HAVING A CERTAIN LENGTH AMPLITUDE AND PERIODICITY 
Telugu-0010-0420	THAT IS TO SAYSOMETHING WHICH CAN EXIST ONLY IN TERMS OF SPACE AND TIME AND AS SOON AS WE ARE DEALING WITH ANYTHING CAPABLE OF THE CONCEPTION OF MEASUREMENT 
Telugu-0010-0421	WE MAY BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH SPIRIT BUT ONLY WITH ONE OF ITS VEHICLES 
Telugu-0010-0422	THEREFORE ALTHOUGH WE MAY PUSH OUR ANALYSIS OF MATTER FURTHER AND EVER FURTHER BACKAND ON THIS LINE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINEDWE SHALL FIND THAT THE POINT AT WHICH SPIRITUAL POWER OR THOUGHTFORCE IS TRANSLATED INTO ETHERIC OR ATOMIC VIBRATION WILL ALWAYS ELUDE US 
Telugu-0010-0423	THEREFORE WE MUST NOT ATTRIBUTE THE ORIGINATION OF IDEAS TO MOLECULAR DISPLACEMENT IN THE BRAIN THOUGH BY THE REACTION OF THE PHYSICAL UPON THE MENTAL WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN OF ABOVE 
Telugu-0010-0424	THE FORMATION OF THOUGHTCHANNELS IN THE GREY MATTER OF THE BRAIN MAY TEND TO FACILITATE THE RECEPTION OF CERTAIN IDEAS 
Telugu-0010-0425	SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CONSCIOUS OF THE ACTION OF THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BRAIN DURING THE INFLUX OF AN INTUITION THE SENSATION BEING THAT OF A SORT OF EXPANSION IN THAT BRAIN AREA 
Telugu-0010-0426	WHICH MIGHT BE COMPARED TO THE OPENING OF A VALVE OR DOOR 
Telugu-0010-0427	BUT ALL ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE THE INFLOW OF INTUITIVE IDEAS BY THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPEDIENT OF TRYING TO OPEN THIS VALVE BY THE EXERCISE OF THE WILL SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED AS LIKELY TO PROVE INJURIOUS TO THE BRAIN 
Telugu-0010-0428	I BELIEVE SOME ORIENTAL SYSTEMS ADVOCATE THIS METHOD BUT WE MAY WELL TRUST THE MIND TO REGULATE THE ACTION OF ITS PHYSICAL CHANNELS IN A MANNER SUITABLE TO ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS
Telugu-0010-0429	INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE MIND BY THE UNNATURAL FORCING OF ITS MECHANICAL INSTRUMENT
