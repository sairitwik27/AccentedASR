0076-7278	 The storm destroyed many of the plants.
0076-7279	The next morning, when the fussy neighbour woke up, she found that the plants have had been uprooted and destroyed.
0076-7280	 However, when the more relaxed neighbour woke up, she found that though the damage to her plants was minor her plants were still firmly rooted.
0076-7281	The plant of the relaxed neighbour had learnt to do things on its own.
0076-7282	 So, it had done its bit of work, grown deep roots, and made a place for itself in the soil.
0076-7283	 Thus, it had stood firm even in the storm.
0076-7284	 However, the fussy neighbour used to do everything for the plant, thereby not teaching the plant how to sustain on its own.
0076-7285	Moral Of The Story:Sooner or later, you have to let go and become independent. Unless you stop fussing, nothing will work on its own.
0076-7286	 The plant of the normal neighbour had done its bit of work and made a place for itself thereby standing firm.

0077-7313	 She went around the jungle, getting weaker and bleeding.
0077-7314	One day, she chanced upon a humble mouse.
0077-7315	 The lioness was in a lot of pain.

0077-7317	 The little mouse after much pain and holds it together for long enough and managed to pull out the thorn from the lioness’s paw and freed her from pain.
0077-7318	Even though the lioness was so big and powerful, and the mouse was so tiny and humble, it was the mouse’s kind gesture that saved the lioness’s life.

0079-7378	 Parvati ended up making a statue of a child from turmeric and breathed life into him.
0079-7379	 She called the child Ganesha, and he was absolutely loyal to her.
0079-7380	 She asked him to guard the home while she took a bath.
0079-7381	 Yet again, Shiva showed up and proceeded to enter the house.
0079-7382	 But this time, he was stopped by Ganesha who refused to move aside.
0079-7383	 Shiva did not know who this unknown child was so he asked his forces to destroy the child.
0079-7384	 But Ganesha had the powers bestowed on him by Parvati and defeated Shiva’s army.
0079-7385	 Shiva, known for his extreme fury, lost control on his temper and ended up beheading Ganesha.

0081-7437	The Story Of The Missing Conch
0081-7438	This is a wonderful story that showed how even Lord Vishnu had to relent to Lord Ganesha’s antics.
0081-7439	Vishnu was known to have a conch with him that he kept with himself at all times.
0081-7440	 One fine day, he noticed that the conch was missing and it was nowhere to be found.
0081-7441	 This got him extremely annoyed and he rallied all his powers into finding the conch.
0081-7442	As the search for the conch was on, Lord Vishnu suddenly began hearing the sound of the conch emanating from a distance.
0081-7443	 He began searching for it in that direction and soon realized that the sound was coming from Mount Kailash itself.
0081-7444	 As he reached the mountain, he found out that the conch had been taken by Lord Ganesha and he was busy blowing it.
0081-7445	 Knowing that Lord Ganesha will not relent easily, he sought out Shiva and asked him to request Ganesha to return the conch back to him.
0081-7446	Shiva said he, too, didn’t have any power of Ganesha’s wishes and the only way to appease him is to perform a puja for him.
0081-7447	 So Lord Vishnu did do that.
0081-7448	 He set up all the necessary elements for the puja and worshipped Ganesha with his heart.
0081-7449	 Seeing this, Ganesha was extremely pleased and he returned Vishnu’s conch back to him.
0081-7450	Moral:The story quite interestingly reveals the fun side to Lord Ganesha and his antics.
0081-7451	 Furthermore, it teaches us about humility by showing how a God as great as Vishnu, did not hesitate to worship Ganesha.

0082-7472	The Story of Shiva's Failed Battle
0082-7473	Lord Shiva and Lord Ganesha have many stories together.
0082-7474	 However, this story goes beyond the relationship between father and son and teaches a very important lesson.
0082-7475	When the elephant head was procured and Ganesha was brought back to life, Shiva heeded Parvati's wishes and made it a rule that before beginning with any new endeavour, it was necessary to worship Lord Ganesha and get his blessings.
0082-7476	 However, Shiva forgot that the rule applied to him as well.
0082-7477	On one such occasion, Shiva was heading out to war with the demons and proceeded to take his entire army along with him for it.
0082-7478	 But in the rush of leaving for the battle, he forgot to worship Ganesha first.
0082-7479	 This led to them facing many problems even before reaching the battlefield.
0082-7480	 On the way to the location of the battle, the war-carriage wheel was damaged and the progress came to a halt.
0082-7481	 This seemed like divine intervention to Shiva and he suddenly remembered that he had totally forgotten to worship Ganesha before heading for battle.
0082-7482	Stopping all his troops, Shiva proceeded to set up the puja then and there and completed the rituals worshipping Ganesha.
0082-7483	 With Ganesha's blessings, Shiva proceeded ahead and he and his army were successful in defeating the demons completely.
0082-7484	Moral:This just goes to show that no matter who you are, once you have created a rule, it applies to everyone equally.

0083-7504	 How can anyone not be grateful to a government that has done more than any of its predecessors to deliver JAM to India's ninty nine percent ?
0083-7505	The Story Of Ganesha’s Wisdom
0083-7506	Lord Ganesha is called the god of knowledge and wisdom and there is a spectacular story that illustrates why it is so.
0083-7507	Ganesha had a younger brother called as Karthikeya.
0083-7508	 Both would get along well but, just like all other siblings, they would have moments of arguments and fights.
0083-7509	 On one such day, Ganesha and Karthikeya both ended up finding a unique fruit in the forest and grabbed it together.
0083-7510	 They refused to share it with each other and started claiming the fruit for themselves.
0083-7511	When they reached Mount Kailash and presented this predicament to Shiva and Parvati, Shiva made a proposition.
0083-7512	 He recognized the fruit and said that this fruit is known to grant immortality and extensive knowledge when eaten by the rightful bearer of it.
0083-7513	 To choose who gets it, Shiva proposed a challenge.
0083-7514	 He asked Ganesha and Karthikeya to circumvent their world three times.
0083-7515	 Whoever would do so first and return to Mount Kailash, would be the rightful owner of the fruit.
0083-7516	Karthikeya immediately hopped onto his pet peacock and flew speedily to complete three revolutions across the Earth.
0083-7517	 Ganesha was a little stocky compared to Karthikeya and his pet was a rat who couldn’t fly.
0083-7518	 Having listened to Shiva’s proposal properly, Ganesha started walking around Shiva and Parvati and completed three circles around them.
0083-7519	 When asked by Shiva, Ganesha replied that Shiva had asked them to circumvent their world.
0083-7520	 And for Ganesha, his parents were more than the world.
0083-7521	 They were the entire universe.
0083-7522	Shiva was touched and impressed by Ganesha’s wisdom and saw him as the rightful owner of the fruit.
0083-7523	Moral:Not only does this story give a great example of how using your wisdom can help resolve a situation smartly, but it also teaches that your parents should be given the respect and love they deserve.

0084-7544	The Story Of Parvati’s Wounds
0084-7545	This wonderful story is a great example of how the entire world is a single unit.
0084-7546	Ganesha was known to be a mischievous child and he would indulge in a number of naughty activities.
0084-7547	 One time, he came across a cat while he was playing, and proceeded to mess around with it.
0084-7548	 He picked up the cat and threw it on the ground, pulling its tail and having fun with it, while the cat meowed in pain.
0084-7549	 Ganesha failed to notice it and played around until he was tired and then came back home.
0084-7550	On reaching Mount Kailash, Ganesha was shocked to see Parvati lying down outside the home, with wounds all over her body, and crying in pain.
0084-7551	 Ganesha rushed to her and asked her who did this.
0084-7552	 To which Parvati replied that Ganesha himself had done this to her.
0084-7553	 The cat was actually a form of Parvati, and she wanted to play around with her son.
0084-7554	 But Ganesha treated her unfairly and ruthlessly and his actions on the cat have reflected on his own mother.
0084-7555	Ganesha was utterly sorry for his behaviour and took an oath to treat all animals in a gentle manner with care and affection.
0084-7556	Moral:This story gives a very important lesson that does unto others as you would want others to do unto you.
0084-7557	 And this also includes animals, being careful of them, and not causing anyone any harm.

0085-7578	The Story Of Kubera’s Downfall
0085-7579	Kubera was a renowned God who was very popular for being the wealthiest of them all in the entire universe.
0085-7580	 He had a treasure trove of wealth and would hoard everything to himself with pride.
0085-7581	One day, he invited many guests over for dinner, including Shiva and Parvati.
0085-7582	 But they both could not attend the dinner, so they sent over Ganesha as their representative.
0085-7583	 Ganesha’s noticed how Kubera’s behaviour was and he decided to let his antics loose.
0085-7584	 He began devouring the dinner speedily and ended up finishing all the food leaving barely anything for the other guests.
0085-7585	 Yet his hunger was not satiated.
0085-7586	 So he ended up entering Kubera’s wealth collection and start eating all the gold and wealthy 0085-s.
0085-7587	 Still unsatisfied, Ganesha then proceeded to eat Kubera himself, who ran to Mount Kailash for protection.
0085-7588	Shiva, seeing the reason behind Ganesha’s doing, offered a simple bowl of cereals to Ganesha.
0085-7589	 He ate them and immediately was satisfied.

0086-7612	The Story Of Kaveri’s Creation
0086-7613	It begins with the wish of a sage called Agastya who wished to create a river that would benefit the people staying in the southern lands.
0086-7614	 The Gods heeded his wish and presented him with a small bowl containing water.
0086-7615	 Wherever he would pour the bowl, the river would originate from there.
0086-7616	Agastya decided to create the origin beyond the mountains of Coorg and proceeded to travel there.
0086-7617	 On the journey, he got tired and began looking for a place to take some rest.
0086-7618	 Just then, he came across a small boy who was standing alone.
0086-7619	 He requested him to hold the pot of water while he went and relieved himself.
0086-7620	 The boy was Ganesha himself.
0086-7621	 He knew what the pot of water was for and realized that the location he was at was perfect for the river.
0086-7622	 So he set the pot down.
0086-7623	When Agastya came back, he saw the pot on the ground and a crow attempting to drink water from it.
0086-7624	 He shooed away the crow, who flew away but not before tipping the pot on the ground.
0086-7625	 This resulted in the river originating from that place itself, which is now called the Kaveri river.
0086-7626	Moral:Sometimes, things may not always work out in the way we wish them to.

0087-7648	The Story Of Ganesha’s Single Tusk
0087-7649	There are many versions that explain this but this Bal Ganesh story does it best.
0087-7650	As legend has it, Mahabharata is Ved Vyas’ creation but it is said to be written by Lord Ganesha himself.
0087-7651	 Ved Vyas approached Ganesha so that he could transcribe the epic story as he narrated it to him.
0087-7652	 The condition was that Vyas had to narrate it without break and Ganesha would write it in a single go.
0087-7653	As they progressed in writing the story, there came a point where the quill that Ganesha was using to write it down broke and he had no other quills with him at that moment.
0087-7654	 Ved Vyas could not stop narrating the story since the condition was already set in stone for him.
0087-7655	 Without wasting any time, Ganesha quickly broke off one of his own tusks and fashioned it into a pen, using it to continue writing the epic without interruption.
0087-7656	 This allowed the epic to become a holy one and Ganesha and Vyas ended up completing it together.
0087-7657	Moral:This story of Ganesha shows very clearly how necessary it is to be disciplined and determined to complete a task once you have accepted to complete it, no matter what happens.
0087-7658	 A personal sacrifice might also be necessary to complete something epic.

0088-7679	The Story of The Lunar Curse
0088-7680	This story follows right after the proceedings of Kubera's dinner.
0088-7681	After eating to his will, Ganesha's stomach had become terribly large and he got a pot belly.
0088-7682	 Walking around with it became difficult for him and as he moved, he ended up losing his balance and stumbled and fell down.
0088-7683	 The moon, who was watching all of this, began laughing at Ganesha's predicament.
0088-7684	 Seeing moon humiliate him, Ganesha cursed the moon, making it completely invisible.
0088-7685	 The moon, realising its mistake, began pleading to Ganesha for forgiveness.
0088-7686	 Relenting to his incessant apologies, Ganesha then decided to set in a cycle where the moon appeared and disappear every fifteen days.
0088-7687	Moral:One should never laugh at somebody else's problems or deformities.

0089-7713	 As she mixed it together and set the pot to cook, she fell asleep and the boy went out to play.
0089-7714	 On waking up, she realized the kheer had cooked and was extremely delicious.
0089-7715	She was too hungry and couldn’t resist it.
0089-7716	 But before eating the kheer, she took out some of it in a bowl and offered it to the Ganesha idol and then began eating the kheer.
0089-7717	 No matter how much she ate, the pot never emptied.
0089-7718	 When the boy returned, the woman gave him the entire pot and confessed that she ate before him because she was hungry.
0089-7719	 The boy replied saying he ate it too when she offered the bowl to the Ganesha idol.
0089-7720	 The woman began crying at his feet and Ganesha blessed her with wealth and health.

0091-7775	The Story of Hanuman Disobeying Lord Rama
0091-7776	Hanuman was considered the biggest devotee of Lord Rama.
0091-7777	 It was believed that he never disobeyed his Lord, however, there was this one time when Hanuman did not agree with Lord Rama.
0091-7778	 This incident happened after the coronation ceremony which made Hanuman extremely sad and disappointed.
0091-7779	 To get over his morose and sullen state, Hanuman starting meditating, sitting in one corner.
0091-7780	 But he was so sad, that tears would not stop rolling from his eyes.
0091-7781	 Seeing him deeply saddened, Sita mata informed Lord Rama about Hanuman’s plight.
0091-7782	 Lord Rama went up to Hanuman and told him that he is in no position to give anything to Hanuman in return for his love and devotion.
0091-7783	 Further, Lord Rama offered that he can only take Hanuman with him to Vaikuntha.
0091-7784	 Listening to this, Hanuman’s face lit up, and he asked Lord Rama if he would be accompanied by Lord Rama to Vaikunth.
0091-7785	 Lord Rama replied that he would be present there but in the form of Mahavishnu.
0091-7786	 Hanuman got disheartened and thus refused to go to Vaikunth.
0091-7787	 He did not want to be present in any place where Lord Rama was not there.

0092-7808	The Story of a Squirrel
0092-7809	The king Ravana had abducted Sita mata and taken her along with him to Lanka.
0092-7810	 There was a massive ocean that Lord Rama had to cross in order to get Sita mata back.
0092-7811	 The entire Vanar sena (army of monkeys) and all the animals started helping Lord Rama to make the bridge to get to Lanka.
0092-7812	 Lord Rama was deeply moved seeing the dedication and passion of his entire army.
0092-7813	 He noticed that a tiny squirrel was also working tirelessly.
0092-7814	 The squirrel picked up tiny stones in her mouth and kept putting them near the boulders.
0092-7815	 The enthusiasm of the little squirrel was crushed by a monkey when he made fun of her saying that she should stay away from the boulder or she would get crushed.
0092-7816	 Seeing the monkey laugh, all the other animals also started making fun of the little squirrel.
0092-7817	 The squirrel was hurt and started crying.
0092-7818	 The upset squirrel went running to Lord Rama and complained about the whole incident.
0092-7819	 Lord Rama then assembled everyone and showed them that how the pebble thrown by the little squirrel was acting as a connector between the two boulders.
0092-7820	 Lord Rama also stated that no contribution is small or big, but what matters is the intent and devotion.
0092-7821	 Appreciating the hard work and effort of the squirrel, Lord Rama lovingly stroked the squirrel’s back.
0092-7822	 The gentle stroke left three stripes on the squirrel’s back.
0092-7823	 It is believed that before this incident squirrels did not have stripes on their body.

0093-7845	The Story About How the Demon King Ravana Got Ten Heads
0093-7846	Ravana was the biggest devotee of Lord Shiva.
0093-7847	 To please Lord Shiva he underwent severe penance.
0093-7848	 One day in order to appease Lord Shiva, Ravana decided to chop off his head.
0093-7849	 When he chopped off his head, it grew back again.
0093-7850	 He kept chopping off his head till his austerity pleased Lord Shiva.
0093-7851	 Lord Shiva thus blessed Ravana with ten heads and Ravana became one of the greatest and the most powerful king.

0093-7857	 One of sages Gritsamada stored milk obtained from Darbha grass in a pot for practising penance and to have Goddess Lakshmi as his daughter.
0093-7858	 Ravana got hold of the milk pot by sneaking into Gritsamada’s house and poured the milk into his own pot.
0093-7859	 Queen Mandodari got so offended by this evil act of Ravana that in order to commit suicide she drank the contents of the pot stored by Ravana.
0093-7860	 After drinking from Ravana’s pot, queen Mandodari did not die, rather she became pregnant with Sita.
0093-7861	 After Sita’s birth, one of the incarnations of Goddess Lakshmi, Mandodari left the baby in Kurukshetra and that is how King Janaka found Sita.
